[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNm3oa_UWiA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNm3oa_UWiA) First, the hardware parameters aren\'t everything.IPhone 5 uses Apple\'s new SoC (System-On-a-Chip) chip is a key advantage of A6,SoC technology can reduce signal access across multiple chip on the system board of the delays caused by the performance limitations, it also enhances system reliability and reduce total system cost. Apple was one of the first SoC for mobile phone design, has a great advantage in this area.A6 use 32nm HKMG technology, using an ARMV7 instruction set, A9 core was not used. Compared to the A5, A6 1 time times the CPU and GPU performance, start Pages 2.1 times times the speed of the application is before opening Keynotes file is 1.7 times times before. Although this chip does not prevail in frequency and core, but some single-threaded test and General Exynos of the most powerful Android platform 4412 compared favorably (on general performance evaluation for mobile phone as described in the science of Lei Feng: how to measure the performance of a mobile phone? 》）。 [Flawless iPhone 6 plus case](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3468290/Jennifer-Lopez-flawless-understated-glamour-agent-s-pre-Oscars-party.html)In addition, even if the CPU parameters is not dominant, but the GPU has been leading, which is why the iPhone\'s image is better than Android phones important reasons.![Alt None](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/279/31541068632_a7821e808d_b.jpg)Secondly, the special effects in image processing, iOS and Android uses a different approach.As we all know, iOS is not an open system, but a system specifically aimed at the few hardware optimization. This makes iOS image effects you can use of the GPU for hardware acceleration, has nothing to do with the software. Android is an open system, in order to adapt to different hardware, many graphical effects require using software rendering, efficiency is low. With \"Project Butter\", Google has made some improvements in version 4.1, but can not do all the special effects were by GPU hardware acceleration.[![Alt Flawless](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6plus/flawless_i6p3004_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/beyonce-flawless-metal-iphone-6-plus-case-p-5288.html)Finally, both system architecture.It\'s history to begin.Android was founded in 2003, early Android is with the goal of replacing the popular BB/Palm/S60 on the market at that time, was not a \"touch\" as the core of the system in 2005, Google acquired Android, Apple iOS development began in the same period, Apple\'s iOS is positioned: a fully developed for finger touch system, a system to subvert the PC/Mac mode, And not to any of the existing product as the goal.![Alt None](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/279/31650509416_576636e713_z.jpg)Android is a Linux kernal and Java shell and virtual machine to run, and iOS systems architecture similar to the Mac OS, and increased communication on Mac OS and touch (Cocoa Touch), while maintaining the power and stability of the iOS system. Relatively inefficient iOS Objectiv-C,Android Java virtual machine, need to consume large amounts of memory to get a relatively smooth speed and memory recovery mechanism is a direct result of the Android interface Caton, although improving the Google version 2.3, however, does not solve the problem.After the iPhone was released, Google Android was rapidly improving, and transform it into a system suitable for touch, but the Android was originally not designed specifically for touch, the frame also has certain limitations, but if you want to override the UI framework has been impossible. Simply put, Android has always been in the original schema patch, they can\'t compare with iOS.In addition to the differences in architecture, which still exists on the touch-screen response and other nuances, iOS is touch-screen operation by the user in the first priority, but Android\'s handling of the touch-screen operation precedence is slightly lower, when the system is busy when not iOS smoothly.While most Android phones iPhone so delicate and smooth, but the needs of different users are diverse, Android\'s vitality lies in its diversity, after all, the iPhone at best, unable to meet everyone\'s needs, then again, if we took with a cell phone to those around me, and that\'s a boring thing.
