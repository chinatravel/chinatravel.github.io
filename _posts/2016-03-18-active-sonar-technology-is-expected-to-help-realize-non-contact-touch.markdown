United States University of Washington research team has developed a non-contact motion-sensing technology for mobile devices FingerIO, principle of this technology using active sonar uses microphones to detect the mobile device user\'s finger movements, without having to touch the screen to operate. In short, this technology can algorithms allow mobile devices become portable radar, non-touch operation detection fingers.
