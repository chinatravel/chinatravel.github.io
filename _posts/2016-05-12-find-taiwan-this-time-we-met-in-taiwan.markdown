Taiwan trip, for me, is that because of the high cost to arrive at a place, than because of the distance of the Northeast, Xinjiang had first arrived.  To the airport there is an old friend, sunny to pick very smooth from the airport bus to the MRT. Jiantan station, from BART to get off I keep taking pictures, see the locomotive Street, couldn\'t help but try very hard to capture. See two small partners had come to, when a bunch of strange faces today are already familiar with, compare first and last impression of what a sigh, things that make forced is special. Ya-Ya is said to see the room 101, I can\'t wait to see Taipei\'s night. To Taiwan, we will eat it!Hai good live in Mong Kok was made into a seafood cuisineDAY2 TaipeiFreshwater-Beitou-Presidential Palace-101-ximending international financial center-twin-Temple  The next day, we set off from the way to their destination, I want to go to is the National Palace Museum, and Chiang Kai-shek square these traditional impression in my mind. Unfortunately, lack of time, all the time varies so he started late. Waiting time, leisurely eating breakfast, through other people\'s circle of friends to see the hotel. Outside the hotel there is a garden, a black car was covered with bird POO ... Issues of environmental good. Hotel\'s Lawn was a a big smile, only be visible if seen from above.\"The view of the city on the road\"\"Super cool red car\"At Tamkang University found in \"could not say secret\" vicinity view which photos   As soon as we began to take the MRT to freshwater Street, are all prepared fresh at sunset, so freshwater Street no one, but the shops had opened well, can see everywhere that you can eat I should hold back, just bought a keychain, so next is hard to find and water are the same thing.  This is because Taiwan in various parts of their care, in addition to infrastructure, construction of other cultures can have its own space for development, so each place has its own something worth buying, if physical enough, met there was something special that can directly start strong.From freshwater Street to us a can see Mt platform, four of us take pictures there, sees local the grandfather, grandmother, wanted to take pictures with them, but they refused, but offered to help the four of us photo.Photo finish also introduced later in Matsu, showed our temples above the ears also have clairvoyant. Later, also was enthusiastic as our guide, taking us to see Taiwan\'s first doctor\'s House.Last we fear time enough on said to Tamkang Middle School, two bit elderly although not too knew road also is go on has direction, Tamkang Middle School in hillsides Shang, not awareness road also really of is hard to find of, next of road we on farewell old people himself go has, just of met feel is accident but is so natural, no several sentence of dialogue Grandpa amojiu active proposed with we go, morning on can experience to local warm of favors.\"High school prom\"Students themselves often occur things the world is fun.  Before passing by an elementary school at Tamkang Middle School, people still class I this holiday people will be pleased. High school open time we stepped in, steel, so the four of us, disguised as students to visit, open only to find camouflaged failed, because they wear uniforms in middle school, but also very handsome and ladies school uniform. Can\'t say the secret of inside, walked into the film\'s illusion. First saw a group of girls on the basketball court rehearsing, we walked then ran up a large group of all, go to the playground.Companion caught a man movie scene where, then go away.Through a corridor from the door of the classroom, home or in class, like a scenes of a classroom furnishings, we walk carefully, do not disturb them in class. Then after class, and we say: \"later, students would rush out\" he sees there is no class said: \"not a good teacher tuotang teacher\" Out of the school had 12 points, to the shops to buy food to take away, plastic wrap, and sweet bread out of the newspapers, oil spill soiled hands.\"Beitou is a famous spa town, on the way to the library to see many magnificent spa hotel\"評 Peitou, one of the world\'s most beautiful port Libraries hahawer book From freshwater back, turned line, only a station, not know why open have is slow, got off didn\'t go several step on see Park General of green, again go on see has has Spa Hotel has, and can smell to sulfur taste has, also can see streams, city city also can see water also really of is rare, came to Peitou library see of than imagine in the of to small, but inside of environment than imagine in the of also to rich, many people are is seriously to sat in floor Shang or chairs Shang reading, seems each personal are has immersed in himself of world in.  Hope to visit one can quietly, do not interfere with the reader\'s world. Library and then the beautiful, not a sincere readers, it is no soul in the building.I\'m sure such a quaint Museum filmThe Hot Springs Museum\"Rapid transit\"Taipei\'s rapid transit not only clean, but there are many cultural exhibitions, hurried travelers will expect them to stop it.Participants view Presidential Hall, because it was almost double, we listened to the \"rumours\" could open the Presidential Palace, so he ran. To find there are closed, although it is under martial law, but still can see up close look to the President, how about no way around facilities. Later, I only see a spectacular military parade on TV screen, contrasts sharply with a few days ago before the arrangement, it is difficult to imagine the way I walk.To view free place to see host post handover Ceremonies which made 儀 DUI 帥 Qi pictures, this is what I want to do a thing, because the place is so famous for, when it comes to Taipei, I can think of is that it at once. Though not in person, but friends painted scene photos was very satisfied. Walk to ximending, will soon go to convince people to go Shan, but not time, we think 101 is absolutely not to be missed, so ride the MRT, walk towards the direction of Xiangshan  I don\'t know why, rapid transit faster than imagined, to 101 in half an hour, at the moment there is very likely to Miss dinner, our team in long (relative to the city is very short) tangled in a long time, after finally going to buy a ticket at full speed on the roof around a circle, and then went to a restaurant.Outcomes are often tragic, we went up, not down, catching the last rays, then look below the eyes glittering lights. Stands near to the area, looking at the lights, cars like the blood flowing in the premises, time 1.1 passes.Finally we forget when I went downstairs and have to queue ... So ... LatePhoto from:@Papa Ying  For dinner, we were late, and at that time was very guilty, and Mao Mao and Xiao-Ying called them together I used to eat. Even when the last photo I felt ashamed not to do - -Walking through the night market next round, had to lamented Taiwan\'s night market is much too big, can see everywhere is delicious, no exaggeration to say, as is surrounded by delicious. He finished his dinner, successfully pulled two people with me go to Hsimenting, MRT so fast anyway, is not afraid to go back. We went to Temple, also open at night, the biggest difference I can find is the temple more glittering, more stylish.  Also didn\'t go to has downtown of end, on go near a article fork prepared to Simon-Cho has, asked has people said walk climbed we lost, recommends we for MRT, MRT only a a station, we intends to by himself go passed, results go with go with road actually has points fork has, bus also didn\'t found, next and just is a MRT export, so decisive modified back has MRT.  Back this afternoon to leave the place, I was surprised, thinking this afternoon walking back until after a number of years, because Eslite in Hsimenting see displayed on the map, some people said no, someone is afraid of closing, but I always think it\'s going to be open, at ximending shopping district is telling the flow of people.  Find Taiwan-most beauty of landscape is people this this book fee has long, first from tourism start, results first was various of travel fans live has, alone travels this a bar on points Taiwan, China, Japan several bar, number also very more, except tourist area block has travels yiwai, other hot books many are is travels class of, that also no wonder yiqian see of travels in why will has so more of Taiwan compatriots has. Hot issue if not we eventually turned to social programs, because this story is the depth of the characters in the book, mostly reflecting Taiwan society.In our three eyes and three pairs of glasses to scan the bar long after everyone was ready to give up, all of a sudden, I found it.DAY3 railroad day tripsMucha-branch-Keelung  Baggage to the new hotel the next day it\'s almost noon, take the MRT muzha station and change to Taiwan well to Chingtung. The MRT line is unmanned, stood in front of the first car is big glasses, there is a roller coaster feel. Under the MRT, did not go a few steps to see the Taiwan good stops from Mucha to Chingtung in about an hour\'s drive, and is the mountain, to enjoy the natural scenery of the mountains, and Taipei City in strong contrast.  Pinghsi line railway is at present Taiwan only one of the three branch lines, Pinghsi railway, natural landscape, and sat on the small train of brilliant color, a station tour at the Pinghsi line, very comfortable. Pinghsi line can said is designed for mining coal mine and new built, cyanine Tong is which maximum of mine, in mining most developed period, cyanine Tong railway station has important of status, although stop mining Hou, now of cyanine Tong has downtown fell do, is still retained with many day according to times of traditional building style, quiet of mountain small town, distributed out thick of Japan wind, to this a tour, enough to was aftertaste past time.\"Shops have a lot of beautiful sky lanterns\"  Choose to fine lines to the end in order to avoid the crowds, then by the end of play. Chingtung in rickety, finally arrived, stood shaking an hour quickly passed out. The car feel cold, feeling weak. Later entered Chingtung lane @ Qiu Na me a small cup of ginger tea, sweet, warm, slowly not so confused.  Understanding Pinghsi because the movie of the year, Shen said at the station \"a lot of things in life is futile.\" Back to the initial starting point. I also try to take a walk on the tracks, railways across the higher mountain slopes, long weeds next to the tracks, I saw this site thought this deserted, which would have thought that at some point a small train chuffed came from a distance. Ticket place setting is a bit cryptic, if I wasn\'t really watching not aware of to buy a ticket. A painted cherry blossoms outside the train came, really wanted to stay outside a bus. First we put lanterns on the shelf, and then people start writing and drawing, there is a train in the Middle too - - - slowly moved away from the tracks as soon as possible.   We are a group of people with some spectacular lantern scene was, particularly when all are focused on Ya-Ya, and Nishikawa, all shot at them, shining like a star -   I worked so hard to write good sky lanterns flying 3 meters place burned down, it feels like the Apollo first in ashesLeft is, we went to Hou Tong cat village. Taiwan\'s train colors are very rich, particularly regional tourist train.Cats can be seen everywhere, and even flower pots will jump out of a lot of cats.Boarded a train to Keelung, a station was asked to the taste of the sea, not far away is the fishing port as it once was.Come Li Gu bakery, packaging is very traditional look, it\'s no wonder peers feel the packaging looks a little \"low\". In fact, this is nostalgic.  People of nostalgia, not just the store packaging.  Cake shop opposite, four sewing machines, hand embroidery, @ Qiu Ye to embroidered with his name in the hat. This reminds me of when MOM and dad are afraid before I lost my clothes, embroidering names on clothing, it is lovely and long story. We went to Keelung, known as \"the three brothers\" bean curd, at first thought it was salty, that hard meat let me accept \"food\", the result is sweet, pearls, pearls of explosion pulp! Red beans, fruit, ice, can\'t eat anymore.Special kinds of, let us into the most is \"cool\" series, cool a cool b call, eat and shy smile.DAY4 HualienHualien train station-secret Canyon-tribal wetland-swallows-loving mother bridge-seven stars LakeFrom Taipei, Hualien train ride. In Hualien, a very nice name, then see the magnificence of the color was a dedicated soul.Though the train looked like a thin layer of silver metal, Interior is very comfortable, especially the multi-purpose toilet, large space, very clean, very advanced and well-equipped. Diapering, seat pads, balabalabala-  In General, the cleanliness of the cars is enough to clean. Compared with the city, the train is so different. Train not only skin, floor, all spotlessly clean. Seat than the Mainland\'s high-speed rail are spacious, legs are very straight, very comfortable lying down.  Taiwan view King of the bus driver, I do not know what we call the King. About drivers really like a kind of King. Us out from the station he was warmly welcomed us, helped us with the luggage, took us to the hotel, and then patiently wait for our luggage.   Mountains often falling rocks in Hualien, drivers as we borrowed two sacks to the helmet, then moved in, told us that if there are a lot of bumps on a railing note here is very dangerous, should not be long.     Hualien windy that day, blowing dust storms on the beach, were it not for the King to give us, I thought it was the fog. Along the way, through his detailed introduction, we understand that a lot of Hualien\'s customs, he was at first jokingly said: \"when I schedule a magistrate to welcome you\" results night dinner time County \"Best Chef\" restaurant to participate in activities. So, we met the head and shook hands. It is a domestic service workers party, Hualien in Taiwan are relatively poor counties, so there will be a lot of people outside, although domestic is not a good work, but can also get recognition and dinner in Hualien, was a place full of human feelings.In the evening, we ate dinner, the driver gave us a ride back to the hotel, when we were struggling when dragging to the station tomorrow, the driver said he would send a car to repair, can drop off us, then we all clap for the driver, did not expect the driver to go day and do their duty no free shuttle in the future for us. We all was deeply touched by this matter becomes also the fact that many of the most touching things.Magnificent vistas, pristine human.At Hualien on the Outlook bar, and received Commission the same day French fries, but shelf life only one day, after only a few days out, burst into tears.Strong sea breeze, blowing sand along the estuary into the roadSuhua Public Road, this section of the coastal road is dangerous, especially when there\'s a typhoon, it is easy to be torn down. Views BA in mountain road driving with, road next of tree long have also is dense of, through blue of sea also only in a moment only will revealed out, such let sea is more of magnificent, water Cliff is is too splendor has, everywhere are is that has never no see had of blue, white of spray broken in reef Shang, blue and white blend have so perfect.   View any text is redundant. Later, we went to mountains to the Taroko, heard the driver introduction there is a route that river, is the father of note, if you must have the opportunity to experience it, especially Taroko mountain, I haven\'t seen enough.Leave the sea, deep in the mountains, only to find the sides of high cliffs, river erosion shaped the Valley, the shape of the Rock River is flowing, the river is the color of lime water, is this after you cut the rock effect? Sandwiched between the mountains, there is a plateau on the thought and illusions. Rocks of grass blowing in the wind like hair drifting to one side, would suddenly have a blue sheep jump out?Taiwan mountains I never made too much understanding, only previously seen Ali under clouds of mountain forests, see those trees and feel the environment around Taiwan mountains is still very primitive. Come to Taroko Gorge, I realized he is plain live too long, looking ahead only to see some buildings on the true meaning of \"mountain\" did not know. And came to the Valley, awareness is back again on the mountain, mountain is used to look up to.Until take off very high after seeing rush out of the cloud peaks, green spines into the blue sea, magnificent, even unreal. Most beautiful place is always so far away, hidden in inaccessible places, sometimes beyond imaginations stay in a place, not in the life slowly diluted in mind but have their own paradise.   There is called the distance.Taroko Gorge carved out of the tunnel before hand, so are raised around the tunnel. We eat back is a piece of grasslands, is back in the mountains, Piedmont only a few around the small room, looking at the mountain suddenly homesick, that feeling of a person walking in the mountains.Has been obsessed with the original expanse of nature, in Hualien, come out from the mountains, finally going to see until we let us marvel at the sea.Pacific today in the afternoon became violent, and a blow to Japan\'s Typhoon peripheral circulation, rushed to the beach by waves two stories high, facing the sea breeze I can rest assured that the forward, met for the first time such a big wind. Glasses hair has been covered with the sea dry salt crystals, face put a layer of powder-like.We rent bicycles, rent a bike. I think we can be normal for a bit in the wind, and we all mess up, blowing like a madman, shouted the sea, lying on the ground is going to be blown away. Then get hair like spray setting water back.Dinner in our \"Best Chef\" restaurant for dinner, held right here in a Sorority, is a domestic service team, play activities.We return to the town in the evening, had just put down our luggage, and I can\'t wait to go for a walk, Hualien Street has no other place so busy, bright, but in any case here, braved strong winds to go for a walk, and somebody is going to buy daily necessities.Gate of the time used Bookstore\"Comics\"  We line four people, by with phone through several Street, then and into has oblique alley, on can see time second-hand Bookstore, said is alley may is called onion cake Street, because in this near also has famous of bomb onion cake, unfortunately I only see sold onion cake of car, and also is two home got have is near, are said must no branch of onion cake shop.. We are looking for something for a long time, @ Wei-ling shoes were bought, tired and not so squat. @ Wei-ling look at night really confused - makes me think of her beautiful voice, is so vacant. Beautiful night time to rush, street signs everywhere, the wind is always big, streets are just getting more solitude.DAY5 KentingFangliao-KentingThe next morning, we caught the King\'s car, just a few minutes to the railway station. Go by train to Fangliao, Kenting, along the paddy fields and the sea, the tracks here is close to the highway of the sea. Rice fields are all green, one can often see Egrets fly from the field, then is the mountain in the distance, with a bright sun, completely out of the window of autumn in the air.By the time that we call ahead for lunch on the pool, to get a two-minute parking period, so the three of us were waiting at the door, and by the time I was ready to rush out to prepare, the doors opened, we have a box lunch to, like a parcel. But those who did not advance to nip out and buy, at the urging of the room clerk, suddenly find it hard to buy a Bento is on the railway. In the city, I always take the train somewhere, all dust is a constant on the train lunch box, how does it taste, I think we all know. At least on food is absolutely terrible.But also on the buses to different parts of the train is going to be different, such as Guangzhou, Tianjin goubuli steamed stuffed bun, after even a small station like crazy through the window to buy chicken, in some places sell pancakes, chicken legs in some places, is also forming a characteristic. The worst time is when floods late, even without eating, like just to get relief in packed after watching a box a box of rice.Get off from Fangliao, Sun that shines, and itching, automatic brain instantly fill a swimming scene. But I have to take a bus to -- we put our luggage in Hualien, bus luggage areas have only one mouth, inside a large amount of space are bent down and went, feeling a little strange, and hear things roll out voice.Don\'t know if fallen asleep, or awake just obtained, soon arrived. Hotels embrace the blue sea, bright sun, put chairs on the balcony, so sit, let the wind blow across the cheeks, and blows the curtains blew into the room. Tired but I just can\'t get to sleep, the sea is near at hand, gotta run.After dinner, some people will go out and tattoo, do not worry not, in fact, all 5 days of the, generally a week or so away. Traveling in the cool pick at is also a lot of fun.Kenting sells garments are brightly coloured, and waterfront area now has new things to see, a bag of small octopus balls, just like in schools around the food stalls outside, and then ease the walk back to the hotel.Despite the fact that I like to go to places few people around, but that hotel space is too large, underground playground facilities were so complete, but no one, not too late, about a cell phone instead of a lot, amusement parks are not needed. Not just the playground, there\'s a supermarket, golf, restaurant, also has a water park is the most exaggerated!! Is invisible to other people, this eerie silence feels so good.Look up into the sky, and white birds flying and the Moon was bright. Through the tunnel, only to see the dark rocks, through the phone\'s Flash, carefully walked out from the reefs, turned out to be the small Bay in the afternoon. Quiet depth of ink of the sea, and Moonlight is very bright.Eclipse black wind high night, fluttering the wind blew the Windows of the room were ringing, Ooh the wind carried me to go outside, only to find Youth Centre is more beautiful at night.DAY6 KentingSail rock-shell sand Islands-long Pan-Marine Park-Oluanpi Park Pavilion-cat nose-guanshan sunsetUp in the morning, we moved to the other side of the Youth Centre, youth centre all look is the ancient House.Each separate rooms of the House are symmetrical, have their own living room and small yard.Came out from the Center to come when you see squirrels in the tree sprang, is not flexible.Stone will look like the sail out of the sea, we look like a poll.Sail rock is located between Kenting and eluanbi, due to its shape like a Hong Kong ship, hence the name. Sail rock about 50 meters high, around 40 meters, is a uplifted coral rock, stone was covered with wild flowers and bushes, birds nest Habitat.Sand island is located in Oluanpi and banana Bay, a small Bay, due to the Gulf is the place where wave energy is reduced, sea shells, insect holes, coral long wave erosion, brilliantly breaking ground into fine sand, with the currents across the seas in the accumulation in the Gulf.Sand dredging before opening time because so many people, resulting in loss of landscape, now closed, in part dug out sand to the visitors, and put the microscope, let people see the true colors of sand.Dragon wind park, scenic grassland plants, look around the vast green landscape, with its next to the deep blue Pacific Ocean scenery, the sea and the sky, it is refreshing, often always attract visitor\'s attention, reluctant to leave.Later saw the Justice of the wheel of the scene. Above the mighty photographer, cell phone in hand and Gopro, a heavy DSLR.This has not stopped loving xiuenPlace on the outskirts of rich vegetation, there were egrets in pace, not like burning place.Eat Morocco specialty foods, we toured their hotels Oman Hotel Super beauty, whether it\'s Hotel in Venetian style mirror is a token show of luxury. Hotel so special, that we delayed Marine Museum visiting hours.Marine Jesus outside the ocean lightSea gate of the original proportion of churning like the whale, is spectacular. Museum also has many forms of marine life, hanging in the air, everyone moving in the same direction---the oceans.

We played a little early, made a farewell. After we went to shopping in Tainan, first went to the Museum of national literature, literary Hall was originally built by the Japanese, from the appearance point of view, the building is very beautiful, thick, Shiji, Greece-style pillars, gray walls, a small main entrance. Going inside, you can see an open spacious lobby, said Art Hall. With some tables and chairs on the Hall, for people to read. Impresses me most was inside the Museum introduced the special details on language, because language is the most important part of a nation, the Pavilion of Hakka, Taiwanese introduction detailed surprised me. Lin said that when they were elementary school like the rest of us, cannot go home, like when we were in school, \"Mandarin\", is small, little partners found to tell the teacher.  In on Taiwan Aboriginal language of Hall in the, has many wood child statue, they representative different of group, and Dang we with hand touch touch child of head, put ear closer to listening to, on can heard belongs to they their group of sleep song, that is gentle of, full love of song, is each personal are can understand of voice, I think layout exhibition of people is is too heart has, through such easily of interactive, can let people understand, various language nature are is as of, are is used to Exchange and passed love of.The narrow door coffee, almost tucked into the box.  Lin asked after we ate mango ice in your mouth, it is too hot, small stall shops are filled with people, watching the bowl after bowl of ice, standing straight greed.Go see Koxinga Temple on the road.   In my opinion, the old man\'s life should be fun, visitors come here every day, it shouldn\'t be too lonely.  Asya restaurant meal, @ Yuanyuan and me and a few friends went, my purchase with them up to go and see, take a look at what else can buy back. Taiwan worth buying besides pineapple cakes, I think are cosmetic, the price is very cheap. Although Hong Kong is very cheap, I don\'t know, feel that since there are friends that I went to see.  Back to the hotel later, troops began to go, then immediately went to the railway station.  First saw the train doors open automatically the moment I freaked out, all young men sat on the ground, one compartment, I thought it was doing nothing to run here, is this arrangement car?  Our bags a lot, is very heavy when the car skidded, Lin said the boxes were moved to their -- after the automatic door closing, brain fill boxes have been moved in the empty compartment picture - -  We hurriedly put the box out, in fact, this car is a bicycle-only cars, don\'t know where bicycles go.  Double today, reject Taiwan turn upon fireworks for more than 10 years in other cities, Taichung was finally put to, so this happened when we were driving less, because there were so many. Taichung railway station, see bus stop waiting for a lot of people, we dragged our luggage went, and came back seeing the Taichung railway station, everyone gasped.

Invention of bubble tea and milk tea with Pearl and fame. A total of 26 stores, Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung have stores in 2007 in China, but no direct stronghold distribution.On the third floor we do tea, as you roll the dice, I\'m not going to tell you how much tea, got a certificate that was later robbed the business.Then there\'s lunch time -Entered Tunghai University, first thing I see is a wide Street, trees are very high on both sides, today\'s wind is particularly cool, trees swaying in the wind. Like in Guangzhou, South China Agricultural University at Tunghai University, kept cows, dairy products to external trafficking. University of dairy products sold far away I do not know, Guangzhou in Guangzhou China farm milk has a lot of places you can buy. Choose to buy dairy products, more is the trust school quality, and the innocent.   Chapel at Tunghai University\'s modern, but very beautiful, surrounded by a large lawn, many people choose to lie on the grass in the Sun, feel the wind blowing. We bought milk, drink under the tree, a gust of wind blew, leaves the debris fell into the Cup, as the drink anyway. Milk ice-cream under the sun shining with attractive, yellowish light, sending imports, it is soft and sweet.In order to find cows we have around a large circle, but have not seen the end of the school, that school is too big, especially in tall trees around, feels like a quiet and peaceful town.   Blocks of fresh beauty of the Japanese people, the appearance of the structure are not the same. If it is a teachers \' dormitory that was too happy. Can live in such a quiet and comfortable environment, plant some flowers in front, which is such a beautiful thing.Wedding light are really super good at Tunghai University, particularly suitable for this beautiful picture High wetlands, \"high rich handsome, white Phu wet land\". Appears to be a about after sunset for people, love, eternal love. When we were sitting in the car, you can see out of the window of egrets, twos and threes flying above the beach at the mouth of the water, not far from a row of windmills, the glow of the setting sun is orange and pink, but too many clouds, the Sun disappeared. A plank road that extends into the sea, many visitors walk there, watching from a distance, easily mistaken for a stake ... Marsh grass was beautiful, pieces next to each other, blowing in the wind like a green wave in turn. And white birds hidden in it, suddenly up and flew away.  On the way back, built on high ground at high speed, so the beauty of Taichung can have a panoramic view, lights, tired of lying on the seat, watching the blaze outside of cities, spaced out, my mind going don\'t know where.    At night, we looked for a Chongqing hot pot on the street, Ya-Ya if XI and pan boss are Chongqing, Sichuan, pepper mouth within days eat light. Original owner is Chongqing, conversations in dialect and her people now, a kind of like the feeling returned to his hometown. The night market which I think is next to Taiwan has one of the most lively night market, should be double or on vacation, or narrow roads, we are the jostle each other and walked out. \"Every methyl night market is located in Taichung situn district to Mandarin road, and Fuxing road, and every methyl road mainly, is full Taiwan maximum and famous of sightseeing night market, every methyl night market of consumption to custom put big bowl for most attract the road hobby night market of people, if met holiday its crowd more is let every methyl night market trunk road plug have packed\"--Baidu Wikipedia said of is Yes.We queued up to buy the large taro sand, very nice, moderate sweetness.   See a shoe shop, flagship stores, but prices are not expensive, about city of around 60 percent, next time we buy some for yourself.    In front of the Feng Chia University there is a street dance competition, Taichung\'s Mayor, just above, there are many people participate in activities take a picture with him on stage, and where we left him waiting, really in front of us, we all shake hands with his pictures. This is not, learned trick star skill. Leave the busy streets, raucous crowd, just as memories of the glamorous these days goodbye. Will be leaving tomorrow, and there was a shed the feelings float up, in a quiet, Dim Street, laughing, but we have tired to dustbins, so walking, walking at the back of the person\'s name, I don\'t know where to go to, and how far to go. All the questions are not a problem, a last, silent night, there\'s a stranger in the street.Concluded by thanking the organizers of Baidu tourism and travel will-THE END-
