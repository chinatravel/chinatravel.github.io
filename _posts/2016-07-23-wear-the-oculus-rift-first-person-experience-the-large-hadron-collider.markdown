![Alt Wear the Oculus Rift, first-person experience the large Hadron Collider](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7566/28204624530_4cdf36e788_z.jpg)European Center for particle physics of the large Hadron Collider will certainly open up a new perspective for our understanding of the universe. 2013 Nobel Physics Prize to Higgs and fulangsuowa·engele, in recognition of their Higgs bosons (also known as the \"God particle\") are forecast, and it is in a particle collider, scientists discovered the \"God particle\". Now, through head-mounted virtual reality equipment Oculus Rift Leap Motion and motion-sensing devices, through the Collider, people will be able to first person experience the 6.4 billion-dollar behemoth.Users wear the Oculus Rift once opened my eyes, you will find that they are \"out\" to Collider synchrotron ring, here is where scientists have observed particle collisions. Of course, not true in the Collider. In the virtual model, the human hand consists of five lines with the Beck logo, slight movement can be reset in front of the virtual world, as if into a giant Kaleidoscope.Video: [Hermes iPhone cover](http://www.reuters.com/article/anglo-american-vote-hermes-idUSL5N17O67J)![Alt Wear the Oculus Rift, first-person experience the large Hadron Collider](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8787/28455625646_68cf724283.jpg)Collider designer Eddie Lee had been the \"God particle,\" reverence \"Collider when it was built a few years ago, I was deeply moved by this pure beauty. His huge body, perfect symmetry, vanishing extension, this is victory of architecture and engineering, it was built for the science, but with this amazing stately beauty. ”Oculus Rift Leap and Motion together to create the project, inspired by science, but from an aesthetic perspective, the changing array of choices is the most hauntingly: permutations and combinations of the sense of science fiction, strange color, graphical modeling, there are 60 \'s psychedelic music. Creative arts games Rez and Electroplankton were involved in Visual design, Japan famous DJ Chi long light has taken music composition.![Alt Wear the Oculus Rift, first-person experience the large Hadron Collider](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7703/28382731032_94eb1f6e84_z.jpg)User experience yet to be reclaimed Virgin [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U414VDsc38o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U414VDsc38o) Behind the Collider complex interface, user interaction design projects. In addition to the reference to \"rail shooter\" (Rail Shooter) players can only along the channel, change the view design, this time Lee for the Collider also joined the simulation player manual element. \"In terms of user experience design, 3D is also a piece of land that is not settled. We as developers are very excited, because we are the decisions of the human-computer interaction. But on the other hand, we fear, how to make a good thing what no previous reference is a difficulty. For example, you can\'t say you double-click action control or something. \"Lee notes that a lot of human movements and gestures, such as pinch and pull, clap your hands, body language in cross-cultural communication in General, and Motion detectors by Leap recognition of these actions.[![Alt Hermes iPhone 5](http://www.awacase.com/images/large/iphone5/hermes_ip4502_lrg.jpg)](http://www.awacase.com/hermes-handbag-case-for-iphone-5-5s-black-p-3542.html)![Alt Wear the Oculus Rift, first-person experience the large Hadron Collider](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8831/28455640186_8bc651c0ac_z.jpg)Not wearing a virtual-reality device can also experience the Collider. User to Leap over the Motion wave projector that projected results accordingly. \"Users want fun fun, want to feel that they can control the game music and Visual graphics. ”Collider produced by Funktronic Labs Game Studio, currently available at Leap Motion store.via wired [Hermes iPhone 5](http://www.awacase.com/hermes-handbag-case-for-iphone-5-5s-black-p-3542.html)
