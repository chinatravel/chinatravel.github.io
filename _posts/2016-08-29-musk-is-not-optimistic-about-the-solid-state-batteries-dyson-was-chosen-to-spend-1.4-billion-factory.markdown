Dyson last year with $ 90 million acquisition of the solid state batteries Sakti3, acquisition of Sakti3, Dyson himself noted that he will invest nearly $ 1 billion to mass production of solid-state batteries. Solid-state battery is a solid electrodes and solid electrolyte batteries, theory of the technology are already well developed, but not yet commercialized, its tricky is to improve production processes and reduce production costs.

Sakti3 solid-state battery by thin film deposition technology for production, internal no liquid electrolyte batteries, instead there is a \"sandwich\" device, the \"mezzanine\" can act as isolators to prevent contact of electrodes reaction and can act as the electrolyte, and ensure the normal transmission of ions.![Alt Musk is not optimistic about the solid state batteries, Dyson was chosen to spend $ 1.4 billion factory](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8363/29202211772_1dd12f1fb6_b.jpg)All-solid-state batteries have a very distinct advantages, security is much higher than the lithium batteries, prone to explosions. Because of lithium ion battery electrolyte for organic liquids, adverse reaction, oxidation at high temperature decomposition, producing gases, combustion tendency will intensify. Solid-state batteries the electrolyte is solid, not liquid, so this problem does not occur.After using all-solid-state electrolyte, suitable materials of lithium-ion battery system changes, the most central point is you don\'t have to use a graphite anode of lithium, but directly using lithium metal anode, this could significantly reduce anode materials consumption, battery energy density has improved significantly. Energy density increases to put more light battery.In addition, there is a characteristic is desirable, all-solid-state batteries can be further optimized, flexible battery. After all-solid-state battery light, through the use of appropriate packaging materials made from batteries can withstand hundreds of thousands of times of bending performance is essentially the decay, resulting in more features and experiences.Last year, Sakti3 claims to have created the energy density of 1.1 per litre kWh battery, a higher energy density than lithium-ion batteries for about 50%, battery storage capacity is twice times the Tesla now use lithium-ion battery, if it can reduce the production cost and capacity expansion to the car battery using levels will pose great threat to Tesla.[![Alt Kenzo iPhone 5 cover](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/iphone5/kenzo_case_ip3006_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/kenzo-iphone-5-case-flowers-yellow-p-3185.html)Although the advantages of solid-state batteries quite a lot, but judging from the present research and development results, the situation is not optimistic. Experts estimate that even if using solid state batteries are the most common vacuum cleaner technology, will cost $ 2000.

In addition, the Tesla is already Nevada Gigafactory invest US $ 5 billion in construction of large lithium-ion battery plant, allegedly let the lithium-ion battery production costs fell 30%.
