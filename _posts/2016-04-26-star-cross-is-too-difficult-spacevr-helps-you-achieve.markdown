Think boarded a ship bound for international space station will be your great pleasure in life? Startup SpaceVR is a new project that looks can take you to outer space, and not fight in zero gravity environment.The basic premise is simple. SpaceVR wants to send a 360 degree view and can shoot 3D HD cameras into space of the picture, the camera captures the image of the universe, so people can explore the universe on the planet. SpaceVR\'s first task is to try to bring their cameras to the international space station, where the camera will be filmed inside and outside of the international space station, so that people can actually imagine is an astronaut, users can see around stars and planets of the Earth through the window.SpaceVR of target is let everyone are can experience to total views effect (Overview effect), total views effect is refers to a in human cognitive Shang of change, dang astronaut in space sailing Shi, because from space or moon surface watch Earth Shi experience of cognitive change: from majority cannot experience of angle observation familiar of homes and the city Shi, produced like world of big and human disputes and the border of small of feeling or idea.Concept of the overall effect by writer falanke·huaide in The Overview Effect-Space Exploration and Human Evolution, this book presents. Third party personnel around these astronauts, also observes these people with space flight experience, before and after the flight there is a clear change in attitudes.SpaceVR Ryan Holmes, founder, CEO and Chief Product Architect said, \"We hope deeply felt by all astronauts, is expected to change their experience of life, which is overall effect for the common people. ” [Disney iPhone plus case](http://www.nodcase.com/disney-leather-flip-wallet-case-for-iphone-6-plus-p-4509.html)But these people are not actually experienced this phenomenon in space, and it is difficult to rely on imagination to experience virtual reality head-mounted devices, for example: Oculus Rift does create a experience that can put you on the spot, and this can trigger us to the deeper understanding of the universe. Holmes said the priority space experience is from the outside of the international space station from the Earth.[![Alt Disney iPhone plus case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6plus/disney_case_i6p611_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/disney-leather-flip-wallet-case-for-iphone-6-plus-p-4509.html)SpaceVR the image captured by the camera and does not necessarily need Oculus Rift or other virtual reality head-mounted device can be seen. Viewers also can pass the smart phone, tablet or computer viewing these images, but in virtual reality headset experience gained on better than other devices.SpaceVR seed investment company is currently seeking to obtain funding of its projects off the ground and into space, then they will turn to raise. Is the first place in SpaceVR wants to explore the international space station, and hope by the end of 2015 to complete its journey to the international space station. After the completion of this project, SpaceVR also has a more ambitious goal, because the company tried to bring their cameras to the moon before 2017, 2022 to asteroids, reach Mars in 2026.
