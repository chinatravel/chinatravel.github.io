RA smart God is not a well known company, get results from search engines, you can understand this is a company in January this year has put publicity his company of laser radar. Recently the company has in the robotics industry, small waves, because their official pushed the Xuan paper, a soft laser mosquito yard Star Wars black technology leads the world, China is going to war--a laser mosquito cannon and laser mosquito robot.This article title slightly awkward recommends RA God smart a new product--a laser mosquito cannon. \"Laser Cannon dozen mosquitoes\" described the landing as the real product of the almost science-fiction, controversial in the robot industry.But what is not known is, is the God RA smart for this article was completely negative. A being described as negative article, how to change as the official soft vision? The \"mosquito laser Cannon\" really work for you?Abandoned after the first handful, one innocent press release ups and careersRA smart God not long ago an interview with Lei Feng network, but refused to deny the reports. Part denied reports appearing in this laser mosquito yard of imminent war in Star Wars article, but the lack of a \"black science\", \"the world\'s first\" modified words.And the reason for rejection is, in fact, recently popular \"Star wardrobe\", worked as a marketing science and technology news service. RA smart edit the document as the official soft vision of God after release, proves this point.In intelligent publishing marketing manuscript version of RA God, Zhou hongyi \"all-glass lenses\" methodology is relatively simple and straightforward introduction to modify the original complex (see below),--and of course, from the reading experience matter.![Alt Aimed at marketing: \"laser mosquito\" can be robot company?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7059/27739360095_b274f03101_b.jpg)![Alt Aimed at marketing: \"laser mosquito\" can be robot company?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7564/27126928314_afda5e8d6a_b.jpg)In addition, anti-mosquito laser from other interviews on the Microsoft evaluation, RA became the founder of God\'s intelligent document Hu Xiaobo\'s comments.![Alt Aimed at marketing: \"laser mosquito\" can be robot company?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7281/27128638263_606864a1da_b.jpg)![Alt Aimed at marketing: \"laser mosquito\" can be robot company?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7438/27126937634_99ef49ee96_b.jpg)It can be seen that this is a public relations company media when free of failures. Both disappointed with the result. Compact intelligent God does not seem to display their technology products to the robot industry, there is no interest in markets and commercial value.Popular science: using laser mosquito-what is technology?Radium in God\'s intelligent document \"black science\" refers to a laser mosquito Cannon, in simple terms is the use of laser burnt the mosquitoes. Laser is a high energy laser weapon, using strong directional emission of a laser beam directly damage or failure. Laser weapon has a fast target transfer speed, firepower (a fraction of the end), the benefit-cost ratio is likely to become must-have weapon for future operation, but due to the laser from the effect of weather, so today the laser weapons also have not gained popularity.Mosquitoes with laser light, in fact, as early as 8 years ago, it has been tried before. This man was neisen·maiwoerde, former Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft, he founded Intellectual Ventures company starting from 2008 the development of mosquito-killing lasers. The inventor of the study group, one of the 20th century astrophysicist Lowell wood 80 Star Wars laser hood has assisted in the design of the cold war, mosquito laser concept partially inspired by this. In February 2010, maiwoerde at the annual TED Conference in long beach, California that demonstrates device. The same year, time magazine named it as one of the 2010 best invention, also registering as well as Apple\'s iPad.Maiwoerde theory of the demonstrate mosquito laser is under mosquito mosquito laser in produced flying vibration of sound waves to determine the exact location of mosquitoes, and then sent laser beams to kill. Laser advantage is speed of a mosquito, there have been experiments show that laser shot per second more than more than 100 mosquito. Meanwhile, highly accurate lasers to identify male and female mosquitoes, because male and female mosquitoes of the sound waves at different frequencies, and male mosquitoes do not bite, identifying mosquitoes \' sex, also avoids unnecessary harm.But the mosquito laser is the most difficult part, and is not laser energy itself, but on the position of mosquito--that is to say, burn a mosquito is not difficult, the difficulty is finding the mosquitoes and quick aiming. Maiwoerde demonstrate mosquito laser is using sound waves and laser laser device of God, Hu Xiaobo refused to Lei feng\'s network (search for \"Lei feng\'s network\", public interest) revealed more of the technical details, just using laser micro-countries described the missile defense system, and says the only power more smaller.Hu Xiaobo Lei Feng network simply demonstrated their laser mosquito Cannon prototype, because there are no mosquitoes, he took a mosquito the size of small seeds attached to a line, and then hang the stone makes a laser mosquito cannon to make a laser. Laser end is on the rocks, but stone does not have any moving throughout the process and no stone damage. Laser for eye damage, said Hu Xiaobo will use face recognition technology to avoid, but at the time of presentation, said that the technology is not yet integrated into a laser cannon.![Alt Aimed at marketing: \"laser mosquito\" can be robot company?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7504/27461384570_129f8abd38_b.jpg)The industry how to evaluate \"laser mosquito\"?When the network after consultation with the staff of military enterprises of Lei feng, said that the more difficult than acoustic positioning is not ordinary businesses can do,\"Direct image tracking and servo system, aiming, the national team do something, this difficulty is not a laser, which was more difficult than missile defense, ABM and ballistic, far target field of view angle is very small, can be tracked. Mosquito when varies on the images up close, can\'t talk. Americans are exploratory, not just the high cost and technical problems. China\'s best technology and team within the system, or BAT.First, the first anti-missile system expertise is very much needed professional expert team, one is certainly not.   This is a system system.Second, this is not a laser, laser has gone, how to find the target, mosquitoes can be stopped in any corner of the room; mosquitoes fly up close quickly, you can\'t use the image tracking solution; and multidimensional fast turntable techniques you know how hard it is. ” [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT0KQ9i_8xQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT0KQ9i_8xQ) The other hand, the intelligent God front also commented that Radium is too long, not enough focus. RA smart God is established in early 2015, in that in a year\'s time, God intelligence had shown the 5 products of radium, includes sweeping robots, service robots and autonomous vehicles. This needs heavy research and development of laser radar technology, products like floor speed is rare. There is industry sources revealed that \"(RA smart of God) product is not stable, stalled sales\", but unable to prove or disprove.RA smart God is currently promoting this \"mosquito laser gun\", most of the interviewed considered the gimmick. After all, if it is a mosquito, has too much than the laser more practical, cheaper and more secure solution. And mosquito channels of such daily consumer goods can be accomplished by deep plowing is not a startup overnight.But there are also the evaluation found that \"they (the God RA smart) got a lot of investment, coupled with the current lasers also have recognized, so the company how well in the future. ”Excessive marketing achievement who hurts whom?Objectively, the LiDAR market is far from mature stage in its product, companies are expanding their seed users. As an important technology for robot vision and laser radar, has been recognized in the trend. Although the situation, there is no statistical significance. Hu Xiaobo had previously admitted to the author himself sweeping LiDAR product is an imitation of the first generation of Robotics Neato products, but later discovered the imitation product structure is not stable, so emergency stop sales of first generation products, engage in research and development into second generation products. According to the person familiar with Raytheon smart business, sales of the first generation of products is almost negligible.

But with the God RA smart, sweeping robots, automatic laser radar applications such as driving a car has been made when was missing in other directions, there is really no second home. [iPhone leather case](http://www.everweek.com/iphone-6-original-leather-case-black-p-2769.html)At present, the RA smart God is to publicize this mosquito laser cannons, and claimed that early next year will have a product listing. Such a drama at home are not uncommon, but excessive marketing brings harm not only myself, but the robot industry as a whole.Laser radar as an important part of robot technology, ushered in the best of times. Hu Xiaobo beginning of 2004 doing fiber lasers, founded the early manufacturer of fiber laser, chuangxin laser manufacturing experience in the factory. On the last energy to lidar, also see the limitless possibilities that future prospects for laser radar. Hu Xiaobo of his company in early publicity played a role, but can be retrieved from the news content and public expression, compact intelligent God showed great ambitions, but wanted too much, there is no clear objectives and strategies of the sort.The \"mosquito laser Cannon\" as product promotion and other product advertising, all claims will be formally launched in the future. Immature products directly to the consumer, the consumer has to pay attention to security risks.The early vision of excessive marketing is undoubtedly the recognition and trust of overdraft for laser radar. Objectively, if the product is successful enough, the negative evaluation of brands and the industry will redouble. This is not the robot industry practitioners would like to see.In addition to the outside before dispersing, laser radar technology for \"mosquito\", a \"experimental\" scene, is also a kind of excessive marketing-using established impression contrasts attracts consumers \' attention. But the laser radar technology at this distance from the end product there, completely ignored the industry comments on the commercial and tend to attract consumers to this lack of understanding technology, whether the proper strategy is a technology company, also is questionable.[![Alt iPhone leather case](http://www.everweek.com/images/large/iphone6/iphone6_case_c6151_lrg.jpg)](http://www.everweek.com/iphone-6-original-leather-case-black-p-2769.html)Tips![Alt Aimed at marketing: \"laser mosquito\" can be robot company?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7380/27461392050_433ab802c9_b.jpg)Micro sweep sweep, author tips bar -![Alt Aimed at marketing: \"laser mosquito\" can be robot company?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7355/27126955544_fc9a568e71.jpg)2840 votesSmartisan T1\r\"Hammer the phone\" is a hammer technologies (Beijing) limited design and development of a high-end Smartphone.
