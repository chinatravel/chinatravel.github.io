Lei feng\'s network (search for \"Lei feng\'s network\" public attention) by writer Xia Heng, Xiaopeng car co-founder and CEO.On June 20, the websites published by the Ministry in accordance with the automotive battery industry standard conditions (hereinafter referred to as the gauge condition of) business directory list of the fourth instalment. Certified companies are of Chinese descent, has attracted industry interest by Samsung SDI, LG and other foreign manufacturers have not selected.According to anecdotes, if new energy vehicles powered by batteries do not have to enter the gauge condition directory, then the new energy vehicles will not be allowed to enter the new energy automobile promotion directory, making it impossible to obtain subsidies. Time, market views, battery manufacturers, such as Samsung and LG headquarters abroad through overseas media to ridicule \"it is to protect the poor, list of China we are miserable! \"Domestic battery manufacturers applauded loudly,\" this is a good initiative to encourage innovation \". New energy automobile market as a whole, and gradually the mist, into a battery of puzzles.

[Michael Kors iPhone 5 Case](http://hellokittycase.blogspot.com/2016/06/can-machines-think-part-two.html)Why do countries at this point in time to launch such a programme, as well as how new energy automobile manufacturers should respond to, the author\'s views are as follows:The first, which the core idea is to standardize the market, improving battery safety requirements, accelerated market of survival of the fittest, will not be able to provide safe, high quality battery solutions manufacturers out of the market.Specifications of \"individual enterprises with an annual output capacity of lithium ion power batteries shall not be less than 200 million MWh, nickel-metal hydride battery production capacity shall not be less than 10 million Watts, super capacitor capacity shall not be less than 5 million Watts, enterprises with an annual output capacity of the system shall not be less than 10000, or 200 million MWh. \"Specification\" enterprises to establish product design and research and development institutions. Equipped with the appropriate research and development equipment, including development tools, software, development and test equipment, prototype equipment. Enterprises should be equipped with appropriate research and development personnel, their proportion of the total number of employees not less than 10% or a total of not less than 100 people. ‚ÄùThis specification, many smaller, did not establish and improve the safety and quality system of enterprises will be eliminated from the market without sufficient research and development, and not insist on independent research and development enterprises, will be eliminated from the market.From we can see, national encourages enterprise investment development, master independent core technology, from low quality, and low price, and with quality of competition of China manufacturing circles, to high quality, and high price, and has core technology, and independent intellectual property of China wisdom made for industry upgrade of determination; from we can see, national always will car security as first class priority, faith with security above all of attitude in governance car industry.As a practitioner of new energy vehicles, we should respond to national policies and auto safety as a top priority, independent research and development, access to technology, access to intellectual property rights as the Foundation of this enterprise. Article 14 of the \"research and development or 10% shall not be less than the total numbers of officers shall not be less than 100\" requirement, I think it\'s too low, should be raised to not less than 30% or 40%, in order to better promote the old path of light from heavy manufacturing, research and development, go to the new emphasis on research and development, core technology on the road.Second, it is widely circulated foreign batteries can\'t access list, enterprise products that are not listed do not receive subsidies, we all have to switch to Chinese-made batteries as soon as possible.I think as long as we insist on independent research and development, whether it\'s outside storms, I take it lightly. First, the regulation does not specify the use of an access list of products without subsidy; second, even if they do not get subsidies provision does not prohibit the use, but lack of government subsidies and high cost.For new energy automobile enterprises, I think every company should have its own market position and play; if our market position is provided as security, products of the highest possible quality, we are there for higher quality, and the courage to give up government subsidies. I\'ve always felt that, enterprises of new energy vehicles, from the very beginning we must learn to face the market growth, but can\'t live off the Government tit linger.So how can we face the market growth? I think the most important is to have our own core technology, and increase investment in research and development, continue to acquire more, updated core technology.We can\'t always crooked nuts are all core technologies to the development, which will cause like traditional cars we can\'t master the most advanced engine technology, has always been controlled by others; more terrible is that some of our companies not only develops all the core technologies to foreign companies, but also by the strong domestic government resources, State subsidies to seize the market.Due to battery costs are often up to vehicle costs more than 35%, countries high costs of subsidies every year, not really used in upgrading technology of new energy vehicles in China, but to help foreign manufacturers to upgrade their technology. If we can state the benefits to independent core technology development, and for the development of the industry as a whole, rectifies.| Technology break through where is the path?In the field of battery-related, core technologies, including \"core technology\", \"battery PACK (package group) technology\" which \"core technology\" the highest level of technology in the world is still largely in the hands of crooked nuts, and \"battery PACK technology,\" China has approached or reached best manufacturers in the world.Battery production technologyTake a look at the current trade fight two of the most popular kinds of cutting-edge technology:Frontline: Graphene battery![Alt New rules on power battery abandoned after Samsung, LG, home to unlock the battery time to puzzle?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7334/27952870116_62ecd92317.jpg)Graphene (two-dimensional carbon)Graphene battery uses lithium-ion in the Graphene surface and fast shuttle between the electrode characteristics, developed a new energy battery.Frontline: superconducting battery (electromagnetic)![Alt New rules on power battery abandoned after Samsung, LG, home to unlock the battery time to puzzle?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7285/27952886626_159913dff4_m.jpg)Superconducting coilSuperconducting magnetic energy storage systems (SMES) is to use superconducting coils of electromagnetic energy stored directly, again when you want to return the electromagnetic energy grid, or other load power facility, it has the advantages of fast response and high efficiency.Description of view, both types of technology are really quite powerful, and is the major industrial countries as a key project to develop depth, is still in the laboratory stage, distances can be mass produced, and very far away, we are actually available, and lithium batteries.Mainstream: the lithium-ion batteryDespite the wide range of batteries, but these type of batteries are often still in stage of laboratory research and development, production is still some distance away.United States Argonne National Laboratories (Argonne National Laboratory) for battery research and development of a five-year project is over four years, engineers in charge of research and development in the short term, lithium-ion battery market is hard to beat.Referring to lithium-ion battery, have to mention here represents the battery cell technology in China and abroad on behalf of BYD and Tesla. BYD\'s electric vehicle carry is a block structure of lithium iron phosphate batteries, Tesla carrying structure of ternary lithium-ion 18650 batteries. Lithium iron phosphate battery has good circulation stable performance, the cost is relatively low. But at present, BYD\'s battery, energy density has reached 130Wh/kg. Energy density has almost reached the ceilings. For high energy high performance pursuit, ternary material electrode materials is an important direction and 18650 batteries are by far the most mature one winding-type lithium-ion batteries, its consistency, long service life, high output, good performance has become the first choice for high end electric, this is Tesla select 18650 as reason for its core programme. 18650 battery PACK group technology of the problem is that it\'s much harder than lithium iron phosphate battery.[![Alt Michael Kors iPhone 5 Case](http://www.awacase.com/images/large/iphone5/michael_kors_ip4009_lrg.jpg)](http://www.awacase.com/michael-kors-iphone-5-case-cover-frost-purple-p-3390.html) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DagdfMAMp84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DagdfMAMp84) Battery PACK technologyBattery pack design should be considered combined with the cooling of the battery pack system, after the temperature below zero, sharp decline in electric vehicle mileage, this characteristic of lithium is inevitable. And better cooling technologies can not only solve the cooling problems, solve problems more efficiently, use of electric vehicles in cold areas who felt the most.Currently on the market common air cooled, liquid-cooled, pipe and many other heat sink. Nissan electric cars use passive cooling mode, BYD and Jac was air cooled, but Tesla opted for a more advanced liquid cooling technology. Liquid-cooling pipe by heating the liquid, and even passed on to each cell, so as to achieve the objective of restoring batteries best discharge temperature, then the battery is full and ensure the consistency of batteries, temperature, battery temperature control in a very small area. This is critical to a more and more of the battery PACK.![Alt New rules on power battery abandoned after Samsung, LG, home to unlock the battery time to puzzle?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7346/27909663071_54dab383ae_z.jpg)Xiaopeng car battery pack module (all rights reserved brand, exclusive licensed car cloud network starts)![Alt New rules on power battery abandoned after Samsung, LG, home to unlock the battery time to puzzle?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7314/27373568323_c9c68bc4c7_z.jpg)Xiaopeng connected to the car battery module fuse diagrams (all rights reserved brand, exclusive licensed car cloud network starts)And currently the more it is air cooled and natural cooling of the battery pack temperature consistency has been a persistent problem. So many electric cars can not fast, and so-called fast is not fast, it is temperature consistency led.7104-electric Tesla Model s total core weight of 544kg, the energy density of about 148Wh/kg. Ternary lithium batteries used, the use of a cross-industry technology, which uses the \"fuse\" connection access to each cell, \"fuse\" in the case of electric current, or a short circuit, cut off the circuit to prevent the danger in time.When accidents occur, delaying the thermal runaway occurs, seek more time to escape. On the Tesla Model s, very good detection, control strategies to achieve a continuous output of high energy battery pack as a whole.Finally mention our small ROC cars themselves.At this stage, we use the best batteries on the market, and with the independent research and development of battery PACK technology (already applied for over 40 patents), now 152Wh/kg bitesila high energy density. Although, for various reasons, I can\'t tell everyone our technical differences in details, but as said above, that, regardless of the policy change, the competition in the future, competition must be the core technology, who has the core technology, who will naturally poised battery in this puzzle.Lei Feng network Note: the author first cloud network, please contact the authorized, must not delete the content.
