![Alt Lesson video: Segway is not the real reason for success](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8873/28688895311_85d9d25a69_b.jpg)Com public accounts of wisdom teeth (zhi_chi), the author itself is balanced player and Autonomic balance car club was founded. From the perspective of his professional, explains why a balanced car after 12 years of this cutting-edge technology equipment still did not enter the mainstream market development reasons. [MIU MIU iPhone 5 Case](http://www.nodcase.com/miu-miu-bag-design-silicone-case-for-iphone-5-5s-black-p-3594.html) As early as the 2010 Forbes Chinese website published a translation of the article why the Segway could not generally popular articles. But this article is quite spare, mostly quote some of the biographical content of the book and trying to analyze why Segway is not popular. It is hard to believe the author is riding this balance.Balance, including the Segway vehicle category, why, after 12 years of development is still not popular? Let a professional interpretation of this issue.Balance car has two major brands in the Chinese consumer, South wind Walker. Headquartered in Dongguan, Windrunner\'s headquarters in Beijing. News that the latter of which received 12 million yuan of financing in the last month. Other brand or not as both sales and influence, or industry specializing in surgery (such as brand-oriented security systems sales in the new century). Meanwhile, there are a large number of beginning balance of entrepreneurial enterprises. I the balance of their car club this month, has received at least three business teams on balancing their own products for testing phone.Balance the origins brand sale on his Segway at home since 2006. But it\'s balanced with all domestic car brands face the same problem.Even I thought the domestic balance current business features with the Segway, even the shortcomings came together.This shortcoming, is precisely the reason for Segway not entirely popular.It is that balance has never been sold as a consumer electronics product.The past ten years, balanced Segway didn\'t even figure out how to sell cars, the results of this question to the Chinese, is a trade policy to replace everything.Segway\'s earliest busy trying to resolve questions of legal policy, and presented in the form of the then-United States President George w Bush, is taking the high road. Harvest, is a public service, including the police order.Thus, Segway patrol equipment to venues face debut--this is not a good place to start.Subsequently, laishi Americans made lively and Segway community their own, but Segway does not seem to individual consumers, continue to busy expanding their scale of Agency orders. Golf carts, Park tour bus concept was created during this period.Composed entirely of consumers and Segway community quickly declined. Decline reasons I didn\'t do research. But one thing is enough to explain the problem--the Segway was born in 12, sold under the conditions of most countries around the world, any Segway damage repair, must be sent back to the United States at headquarters maintenance. Question not only policy, but the Segway did not consider whether or not to let the distributor with the after-sales maintenance for individual customers.Home has large holdings of Segway users, many of whom are abandoned because of failure and maintenance too inconvenient balance. Little Guan, has more than 10 damage to the Segway. (Want to pay 80,000 yuan for balanced play, mostly without too much care about the 80,000-dollar boondoggle)Who can accept this situation last purchasing Segway? Equipment leasing business.Most such enterprises in Sanya, there are many brokers in rent from the leasing company to a full day to Segway, ride to all five-star hotels on the beach, playing half an hour 300-500 to rent to tourists.[![Alt MIU MIU iPhone 5 Case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/iphone5/miu_miu_iphone_case_ip4908_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/miu-miu-bag-design-silicone-case-for-iphone-5-5s-black-p-3594.html)In that case, Segway has become a tool, some business income. Maintenance and after sale of the business, without any personal feelings, trouble also does not matter.Busy pursuing short sales Segway messed up from the start of \"balanced\" Psychology of cognition. It piqued public curiosity, does not care how to build products with buyer\'s feelings. Business user\'s attention far more than individual users.Not because it purchased equipment, only the means of production. Is to become a successful consumer electronic product. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCtR-ARh1aY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCtR-ARh1aY) From this perspective, in the eyes of the Segway, balanced vehicles and excavators or drill makes no difference. Segway without success so far--as the means of production, balanced car is inefficient because its usefulness is the biggest short Board, and there is no need.The bad habit of Segway, also infected domestic in 2006 coming into balance after people in the car industry.This transmission is a complex process. Balance on the one hand the process of localization in China of the product itself, is the process of supply chain down to the end product. Imagine how do you sell an electronic component supplier of enterprise or profile of products;The other hand, the Segway itself does not do product position, that domestic counterparts do not know what the reference model to sell even car-or even do not know how to balance car definition.In the United States, Segway is not just a brand, but is defined as a category. So, China needs a new name, the results varied are out--the name derives from the transliteration of \"photo\", \"thought\", according to the technology of \"intelligent vehicles\", \"walking robot\", according to the usage of \"car,\" according to brands such as \"easy step\" ... ... Ranged in size.Need to thank Bo and Jinan in the matter, he clearly reads \"power balance\" five words is a contribution to the industry\'s largest--in 2013 and unifies the scientific name for this category from the mass level.Name does not matter, but the categories fuzzy makes the balance of all car brands in China avoid detours – is still not back on track.Initially, trading practices from the supply chain system, balancing car manufacturers to sell to the dealer link mission. It is shirking its responsibility, because the dealer is not very clear how much balance. Then, in what appears to be achieved after the initial excitement, manufacturers and distributors are in confusion.Next, mutual began fumbling. Based on the relatively expensive prices, balanced car manufacturers trying to mature luxury car sales channel to sell your car-the results are poor. And most of the stores experienced in professional dealers, sold began to use store, and with the transformation of retail property (from department stores to urban complexes) and achieved certain results.Thus, in franchise mode, both sides continue to the stones. At this situation, dealers are already strong in the manufacturer\'s, so the possibility of firm stores are significantly compressed--is seen as affecting the interests of dealers. And so with different dealers understand the product is different, different business strategies, product portfolio (most dealers but also agents of other categories of products), and consumers on balance of different dealers to buy cars, acquired experience and knowledge are not the same.Result is that after two or three years of development, balanced vehicles sold, but consumers still up for balance of practicality, and the cognitive level is close to this product is space patrol special tools or advanced toy for rich kids, not a mass product. And they balanced car and cell phone should be more than middle-class comes standard with electronic devices would have been considered impossible. Even the most purchased the balance of private car owners often embarrassed to drive balanced out.And for dealers, par balance only and cars or luxury car sales, but does not offer them the same level of profit, switch to rental or business services, no less--for the balance of the car manufacturer, which took the road of Segway.For vendors, as of today, China has not balanced the car manufacturers for media and consumer product launches – held their product launches, more precisely is the Distributor Assembly. Relationships between products and consumers, is not a topic of concern.That\'s as of today, balancing the overall car market in China, as well as the reasons why the Segway did not succeed.Looking forward to tomorrow, my own judgment is balancing this category will break out in a two-year period, as well as domestic mobile phone two years ago. The reason is simple, current trends in all smart devices are connected to each other and interact. Home WiFi environment made the first wave of outbreaks of smart devices based on different linkage screen--your mobile phone, Tablet, television has become a smart chain surrounding the individual. [MIU MIU iPhone 5 Case](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/dresses/sleeveless/miu-miu-printed-silk-dress-w-slash-tags)Two trends of the second wave has arrived--Smart cars with wearable devices. Surrounded by intelligent chain has a hint of personal article. Not only Tesla, almost all car brands were started on the new products development to join the wireless network and home network systems. Not to mention gene sufficiently Orthodox wearable mobile Internet devices series., Including balance, more new cool article III intelligent smart devices will become personal chain; or balance this item going to be WiFi through family environment and Auto network the key point – there are many possibilities. Starting from the second half of the year, balanced car, have been able to install the 3G SIM card, then from the large embedded operating systems and a mobile Internet application platform, there are far too.But the opportunity did not belong to the Segway, which made balancing the car manufacturers say. Say, who was first able to detonate their products really as popular consumer electronics products, who is the first combing clear supply chain capacity and dealer relations, who was the first to complete the market balance everyday use ... ... Maximum chance of who.Segway has no chance causes and failed because eBay in China--too long decision-making processes, indifference to individual users, and not enough intelligence products.Segway does that cost 80,000 yuan in workmanship and performance details than on domestic products, but for the average price of 2-3 million average price of domestic products by 80,000 release cost boutique, beyond the Segway is not difficult--after all, and like the iPhone, in the United States sells Segway done most of the components and processes in China. ![Alt Lesson video: Segway is not the real reason for success](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8632/28660904232_16d620fa16_z.jpg)
