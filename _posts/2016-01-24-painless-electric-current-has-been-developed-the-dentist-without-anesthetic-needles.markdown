From Brazil\'s researchers have developed a new type of anesthetic techniques, the next time you go to the dentist\'s Office, they were no longer anesthetic injection. The new technology uses a painless local anesthetic effect of micro-currents to increase, the research team said they have achieve a rapid and lasting effects on animals.　　Typically, local anesthetic is used to resolve pain caused by anesthesia needles, such as gel containing lidocaine and Prilocaine. However, from the University of Sao Paulo research team wants to explore the possibility of using a local anesthetic reinforcement to replace needle anesthesia and anesthesia.

Researchers said this new method can not only encourage people who can\'t go to the dentist because of the fear of needles, can also save the cost of anesthesia, and reduce the risk of contamination and infection.　　The study author Renata Fonseca Vianna Lopez said: \"no needles anesthesia can save costs and improve patient compliance, ease of use and reduce the risk of poisoning and infections. This new technology might bring to tens of thousands of people around the world better and safer dental treatment services. ”　　A new anaesthesia anaesthetic gel is the first step in adding a polymer, to enable them to firmly stick to the lining of the mouth. And then use the propylamine hydrochloride ropivacaine (PCL) and Ricardo hydrochloride (LCL) two additional anesthetics, and finally applying current. This form of anesthesia is very fast, and very durable, the osmotic effect of anesthesia has increased 12 times times than before.　　It is understood that the results of this research have been published in professional journals. The team\'s next step is in clinical trials testing the effect of technology on the human body. In addition, several drugs, including cancer treatment may also benefit from this technology.　　When Renata Fonseca Vianna Lopez in an interview said: \"in the past couple of years, our research group has been working to develop a new drug delivery system for the treatment of skin and eye disease. Medication has been in the eyes and skin are no small difficulties, so we focused on using nano-drug delivery, iontophoresis, ultrasound imports and the effect of sound wave penetration to improve these areas. ”　　In fact, the use of current is not a new concept in dental. As early as 2014, United Kingdom King\'s College researchers have developed a painless electrical current to help tooth enamel to get calcium, phosphate, and other substances. However, this technology to commercial needs to continue raising money.
