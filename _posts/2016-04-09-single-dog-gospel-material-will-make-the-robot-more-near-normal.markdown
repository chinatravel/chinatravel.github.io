In China, due to various reasons now tens of millions of more boys than girls \"Wolf meat\". So singles can say is an inevitable phenomenon. Of course, for those who Gao Fushuai, dwarf rich handsome Gao Fuchou and short rich ugly girls, and those who have bent the friends, don\'t have to worry about this issue. However, a minority have five conditions are met.[![Alt Cath Kidston](http://www.awacase.com/images/large/i6plus/cath_kidston_i6p300_lrg.jpg)](http://www.awacase.com/cath-kidston-iphone-6-plus-case-rose-yellow-p-4262.html)　　Of course, you can also say: more girls than boys in Latvia 12%, can earn the green card. This of course is a method, but if you can, and love to talk about a robot also appears to be a good choice.　　In fact, this idea has appeared in many comics or literature, more well-known such as the type of Angel heart. In reality, however, this is difficult to achieve, because the robot action can never be as soft and flexible as normal human beings. A large part of the reason is due to the robot if you often make a bending action, is very easy to wear. So when you see a robot when, no matter how advanced, but always is very stiff.　　But now, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, found a way to solve this problem, they developed a gel that can be achieved make electronic circuit bending crack repair themselves. This material in artificial skin and soft type robot development, can have a substantial impact in the field of medicine.

If it is given an excellent artificial intelligence system, it will seem ordinary people without any distinction. And it is definitely not repulsed by some of your weaknesses, with one such robot, I believe many people will be very happy.　　Just do not know, in the future there will be a lot of XX.[Article correction] [Cath Kidston iPhone 6 plus cases](https://uag2015.wordpress.com/2016/03/23/tanzheng-ant-and-science-and-technology-the-dream-into-a-reality/) []() Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: robot\r Science and technology And anecdotes
