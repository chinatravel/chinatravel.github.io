business need the layout is as follows:Information serviceNew layout in America in information services for businesses and stores information, user reviews data and information portal, where the first two major rapid cognitive business services to help users in order to help the user select the consumer shops, the latter to meet the users \' reading needs, improve the understanding and awareness of life services.With public comments in the local industry status in life, the new United States in the field of business reviews are far ahead, and life field of information portal, new American and not the layout.Marketing toolsAt the marketing level, new American Assembly gradually transforms into a secondary business marketing solutions provider, this needs based on their business products and services for businesses launched include membership certificates, buy, Flash-benefits and effects of advertising and other promotional tools, which let businesses across all industries are based on their own needs, flexible options to suit your promotional tools to enhance its customer acquisition.![Alt New us-p wanted to be 200 billion valuation of the life services giant, in addition to the layout and split, and broken homes](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7394/27240764694_e1bb038150_b.jpg)Connecting businesses and users-guiding pathsSome common promotional tools listed below, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the tool:(1) membership certificates: business marketing tool for maintaining user stickiness, mainly serving the old user, new users become users or try to be. Old user accounts for high and low, determines the marketing resources of businesses access to new users, due by way of membership certificates to maintain old customers, significantly reducing marketing spending;(2) Flash preference service: Flash benefits by way of small concessions, users are encouraged to make an online payment to complete the transaction closed-loop will not only help businesses acquire new customers, and help desk operators accumulated data;(3) buying patterns: model through targeted promotions, biggest pull new users, help or fails, the newly formed businesses increase customer volume, this kind of promotion method is the most direct and effective, businesses have the highest cost; (Commission model)(4) the effect of advertising: the main needle brand shops or specialty shops, through the effect of advertising and marketing, and businessmen close to sell products and services to potential customers to rapidly expand business visibility;(5) marketing: the merchant products and services packaged into a way of life, communicate with the content to a user, help users improve or try a new lifestyle;These marketing tools, as well as a variety of service infrastructure, the new United States 2%-3% Commission rates are now raised around 3%-5%.InfrastructureConnecting businesses and users-guiding pathsNew us-the O2O commerce infrastructure needed to build the main map street view, payment of the financial, logistics and recommendation engines to four in the same city, this infrastructure is the link connecting the user and the business.Oriented businesses New beauty business to provide basic services including data analysis, employee hiring, join, storefront leasing, commercial cloud services, store information systems, supply chain finance and procurement of raw materials/equipment, and the businesses within the entire business life cycle, very simple and efficient. So many business and infrastructure together for the business user to provide a full service business scenario, between units and business eco-efficiency Guide, fine work, enhance the efficiency of industry, forming an efficient operation of local living services ecosystem.2, business spun off to develop in depthIn the field of e-commerce, both Taobao, cat and the East of Beijing, are essentially selling goods. After these goods in the production of packaging, just like businesses internal processes are not much, the rest of the sales cycles, different products have similar processes where users browse orders, then business package delivery, which is why e-commerce platform to cover the dozens of hundreds of categories, depend on large scale to get revenue.O2O fields opposite, however, each industry has markedly different places with other industries, providing services often work closely with the associated business process, this means that different industry segments a user process (from the demand to the end of service) vary widely, does not form a unified platform like a electrical contractor.Popular to say, O2O area, to provide services to you, need to talk business, with industry processes in areas such as depth to get through, including the business models of how to make money, so you know about the industry even further, and targeted solutions.O2O niche is the best way to do with vertical division or separate subsidiaries way deep into these segments, when necessary, can be broken up independent financing so as to integrate the sectors upstream and downstream resources, form a rooted in local service niche.So, when we look to the future to see when a new US business, you will find dozens of subdivisions of its category, are dozens of hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of billions of dollars of business groups, they are deep in a different niche, help the industry enhance efficiency and service quality, and significantly reduce business costs, and get their own share of the reward.However, this does not mean that no correlation between these different segments of the business, instead they are closely associated in many aspects still or shared set of service system, such as traffic portals, unified information services, a unified marketing tools, unified infrastructure, unified merchant services, which ensure that category in different segments of the same link, through the unified scale services to reduce costs.3, reduce the cost of information processingWhile the Internet has reduced local service areas of asymmetric information, however many links in this field there is still a great deal of information exchange, operating costs.To take a simple example: when a dish in a restaurant after a sold out, how this information is synchronized in real time to the restaurant in the new Web shop of America? Spooling through employees do take 10 minutes to complete a series of actions, such high operating costs mean it is not real, so in the context of the original technology, local O2O hard to do true real-time network services.So we see local life line Shang service although some advantage, but also some disadvantage, this led to many when didn\'t necessary prior view line Shang information, then again decided whether to store, like often to of downstairs Wuhan hot dry noodle, didn\'t necessary Xia once to zhiqian first open mass reviews browse a, this also led to even is achieved has above full industry chain layout, still cannot do businesses of daily water through new beauty big platform. Therefore, an important mission for the new America: through a variety of technology upgrades to enhance online services advantages as possible users into line, elevate the water line.Artificial intelligence technology currently under development, will change this high of information acquisition and processing costs. As we have seen, AlphaGo vast amounts of data into the Board as chess strategy, information need to spend a lot of time collecting, processing, new technology programme moments away, maybe it will be a completely new idea, thought, awakening.In the field of information services in the future, artificial intelligence like the machines of the industrial age, a significant reduction in processing costs, exponentially increasing the speed of information processing, and ultimately enhance online advantage, truly through the online query before making decisions in real time, better than a trip.  [Marcelo Burlon Cases](http://m.aliexpress.com/item/32557934859.html)This calls for new us big in the in-depth work on artificial intelligence technology, and its real-world applications to their business scenarios, such as recommendation engines through research and development, and to reduce the cost of matching between user needs and business services, by making smart hardware tools, information acquisition and processing to reduce the business costs by making talking AI, real-time communication and understanding with the user needs.Taking into account the artificial intelligence is the Internet (reduced information) again after reducing the cost of information, processing core, so the new layout should be stepped up on artificial intelligence technology of America, enjoy the development opportunities of technology upgrades.Segment business choiceUnder the above 3 logic, buy, reviews of the new American business will becomes the great soil, its broader business coverage, will differentiate into dozens of subdivisions of local life service business, and each of its business segments will be through deep integration, more depth, wide with upstream and downstream connections, thus becoming a commercial niche segments.![Alt New us-p wanted to be 200 billion valuation of the life services giant, in addition to the layout and split, and broken homes](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7362/27751652312_fb411d2bfc_b.jpg)New industry segments of America categoryGiven limited resources, the new American and when the layout up to dozens of business segments, needs to carefully consider a choice, choose the size of those markets, to good earnings prospects stepped up in the area to develop, such as food, education and training, beauty, and for those who have developed the field, Excel by working capital leave, such as movie tickets, hotel, tourism, and so on.Need to focus on the development of the field is as follows:(1) dining area: includes menus, catering, takeout and other ingredients, to shop, is the largest segment of local services, and most areas of high frequency, this is a contested market, but is in need of attention, take-away dining area only a small segment of the industry.(2) training and recruitment: training, recruitment, such as part-time jobs, early childhood education, closely linked to training and recruitment industry, belongs to an area (like online travel distance of travel and hotel reservations), is also the most effective way to promote employment in the future, considering that China is in a period of industrial restructuring and training recruitment prospects in the future.(3) beauty wedding areas: contains salons, beauty, cosmetics, dance, wedding, photography, is a traditional advantage business group reviews, needs to take a deep and thorough.(4) home service: includes housekeeping, laundry, home repair, move, lock, waste recycling, water, pets, potted plants and so on, although there are 58 home first, but this is a market of hundreds of millions of size, cannot be achieved by a company to take, and is still in its early layout, group reviews it is necessary to vigorously into this field.(5) recreation area: contains KTV, gym, bar, card, performances, foot massage, bathing, recreation, leisure and entertainment is the traditional advantages of the Group reviews business, needs to take a deep and thorough.Capital abandoned areas are as follows:(1) the field of online travelOnline travel area includes: long-distance travel, hotel reservations, ticket booking, international tourism in four market segments, the four belong to the online travel market segment, but business connection is not very close to each other, which lead to a more fragmented market, and there were no monopoly situation.Long distance travel: offsite trip includes airfare, rail booking, where to go in this area, ctrip market share dominance and substantial shareholder in ctrip is where, ctrip controls most of the market share in this area, while the group, Ali travels, the same way, way cattle are opening up this market;Hotel scheduled: Hotel scheduled field main contains high-end hotel, and low-end hotel two market, which in high-end hotel reservation field, ctrip (Baidu is ctrip of big shareholders) in monopoly status, and has deep this a market for decades years, second is art Dragon, now has was ctrip shares became big shareholders; in low-end Hotel scheduled field, beauty mission Hotel relies on buy, and entrance advantage quickly rise, currently market share accounted for excellent, while to which in ctrip of support Xia continued attack low-end hotel reservation field, Defense beauty mission hotel of competition, And Ali travel also actively explore the market.Ticket reservations: attractions tickets reservation and leisure areas in the country, the same way networks is an industry leader (supported by the company for a long time), through long-term roots in already has a lot of offline sources, business expansion, is impersonating a major international tourism markets, while the development of hotels, ticket booking market;International tourism: in the field of outbound, way cattle network is an industry leader (supported by the China Southern Airlines, East of Beijing), decades of deep accumulation of outbound tours are being turned to domestic travel market and drive NET offensive;Through the above simple analysis, we can conclude that online travel is a new powerful market, and there are a large number of forces behind to support the parties, are relying on their own strengths to each other attempting to preempt other areas get a cup of American Pie, and this background meant that online travel area will remain in a highly competitive State.In beauty mission most at of low-end Hotel scheduled field, although relies on Yu buy and O2O life entrance occupy has large market share, but still by has from ctrip Department (to to which for Vanguard) of strong sniper, consider to ctrip is a long-term profit of group, has 3.2 billion dollars cash reserves, if new beauty big wants to forced attack in the high-end market means with tragic of subsidies war, this will consumption large of cash, for in venture period of new beauty big for, no necessary, if continued of wait-and-see, Ctrip is undermining the advantage with the brand, so to speak, hotel reservation business case for new beauty, is a chicken business, tasteless but wasteful.Other three a field in the, in far from travel field new beauty big does not accounted for excellent, although investment has tickets direct platform will to technology, take this padded tickets short Board, but market share still sharply behind Yu ctrip Department, and in free line field, new beauty big market share also behind Yu with drive network, which 2015 GMV reached 25 billion, has 12,000 name employees (about for new beauty big employees reviewed one-third), and in continued for Shang downstream resources integration deep, this means with new beauty big hard comeback.Online travel area at this competition means a new beauty is hard to rely on market share development have become a profit-making business, based on this, the best of the new American strategy for capital consolidation gradually abandoned this area, but will also save a lot of cash into other segments, improve capital efficiency.Taking into account the new American Yamato stood behind Tencent, through the integration of capital, to merge its online travel business package with the same way, and large share in Exchange for the latter would be a good solution, this got rid of not only a loss of business and avoid paying money competition, and sit back and enjoy the development dividend.(2) the field of movie ticketsAlthough cat eye films with the help of beautiful round purchasing to achieve industry first, but continues to face photo times and Baidu Taobao, glutinous rice, the film\'s fierce competition, with greater perspective in this area, will find the upper reaches of the market such as Wanda cinema line big video sites, competition from pirated from downriver, at the heart of competition. If you really want to do in this area will need to invest massive resources integration of upstream and downstream resource (cinema links, content creation, video site), forming a near-monopoly of the stable niche, separated to compete for a small profit.Taking into account the national box office market are only tens of billions of (2015 for 44 billion), such a small market, does not seem worthy investment. So the new American is a collective overestimation of the time in the wise cat eye films sold to 8.33 billion yuan valuation 57.4% stake in the media will not only help the cat\'s eye movies complete industry chain ecological layout, increase channel link\'s profits, but also got rid of the group a loss-making business, withdrawal of more than 4 billion of the funds.Catering business [Marcelo Burlon iPhone 5 Cases](http://www.nodcase.com/marcelo-burlon-hard-back-case-for-iphone-5-5s-wolf-p-3705.html)Major 5 large segments of the group, and gourmet dining is the most high is also the largest market segment, the new American, like Taobao clothes, East of 3C, is the core of category layouts, will prop up the whole new ecology of America.![Alt New us-p wanted to be 200 billion valuation of the life services giant, in addition to the layout and split, and broken homes](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7336/27240917633_4e020928c5_b.jpg)Dining areas vertical links divided intoThe vertical perspective, future dining area consists mainly of agricultural product circulation, butt and health management services three links. In circulation, market B2B appeared on food network and cutting-edge, new American, no doubt, invest a lot of resources to bring beauty shop owners, users, resource, quickly into this area.![Alt New us-p wanted to be 200 billion valuation of the life services giant, in addition to the layout and split, and broken homes](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7443/27240923233_45fc5481c0_b.jpg)Dining areaLandscape orientation, dining area consists of 3 segments, namely: family to shop dining, catering and take-out services, which the family restaurant market the largest, followed by catering to shop, external service minimum, so the layout of the new catering service should be expanded accordingly.Briefly below 3 segments: Family diningFamily catering field field contains: food material spices, and menu recipes, and lifestyle, and tableware kitchen, and diet health six most, which food material spices, and catering kitchen involves electric business plate, need gradually layout perfect; menu recipes, and lifestyle involves information service aspects, can select acquisition bean fruit food, and good bean recipes, recipes servicers, while built himself of life content service platform; diet health involves catering and medical health field, may will involves data analysis and medical recommends aspects. To store food and beverageTo store food and beverage is the core restaurant business, downstream of millions of restaurants, like Taobao/cat mega-seller platforms on a platform, with baiyiji revenue creation potential, it needs to launch a range of tools and services in the field of America, conducted intensive, thereby enhancing the operational efficiency of the industry.Need to roll out a wide range of services as follows: Food supply: B2B food procurement (reduced business procurement process), the local logistics and distribution services (to not facilitate the purchase of businesses to provide distribution services, reduce business cost);Business management: catering ERP system (has shares Ishikawa technology, and days fiscal shanglong, through information improve operation efficiency), and intelligent shop built (launched cloud system and hardware innovation platform, need mobilization create guest power invention hardware, for merchant created a more comfortable, and personalized of service experience), and data analysis service (combined Tencent LBS data, and user portrait, beauty mission user data for local user group, and businesses category analysis service, real-time understand competition State and should programme), and Businesses financial support (launched supply chain financial service, improve businesses anti-risk capacity), and CRM/online points meal (has shares Shanghai cleverdragon, and big mouth, and food for days information, through information upgrade customer relationship management), and cloud computing support (recommends and Tencent cloud cooperation, profit aspects 2:8 into, beauty mission took bulls, through cloud computing for merchant upgrade information service), and recruitment service (through new beauty big education training business, for businesses provides a station type recruitment, and training service), and Lease of commercial premises (at open query, lease of commercial premises available to the service directly to establish a deep connection with elite shops)Customer acquisition: Flash effect benefits services, buy, advertising (advertising platform launch effect), LBS advertising, content marketing (launched open content platform, embedded in the American Mission, the reviews APP);Customer service: recommendation engines (advancing artificial intelligence research, research and development recommendation engine technology), AI services (advance artificial intelligence research, to explore the chat robot world), online payment (application or purchase access to third party payment photo), consumer finance (through company credit data to launch consumer credit service), local distribution;Through for businesses provides above series service, will makes its and businesses established depth of connection relationship, significantly upgrade catering food field of industry efficiency, not only so, in customer gets aspects, new beauty general change has thousands of years to businesses pay expensive housing rent gets line Xia passenger of way, more customer will like through APP, and recommended engine, and AI of way select himself like of food, shops location no longer became preferred.Takeaway businessTakeout is to store food and local logistics of a new niche that market size than the restaurants and stores catering, but as it is generally good, popular capital in this market popularity, coupled with the support of BAT, beautiful round out, hungry, Baidu takeout is focus on market share in the face of fierce competition with each other.With time of development, outside sold began by catering distribution, played into to local logistics for support, distribution fruits and vegetables, and convenience shop, and drug, and dessert, variety category, even so, still cannot out low price, and more service (personnel first to hotel buy, again rushed to customer at, process of long), and strong limitation (one hours within to) of characteristics, again plus so fierce of subsidies competition, makes this a field short-term within hard losses turned surplus. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzmwD3b-GLw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzmwD3b-GLw) New American, restaurants is the core service areas of life, is the focus of many of its business segments, so takeout area must not be lost, and beautiful round out the best strategy is:, accompanied by continuing to play, but the need to save money, thereby putting more money to open up other areas.
