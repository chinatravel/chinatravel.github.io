For many years, it is millions of people daily life on the Internet portal, which is the world\'s most valuable Internet money machine. However, as more and more people turn their attention away from the desktop computer, Google\'s fortunes will change. Recently Google announced in a blog post at least 10 countries mobile search volume than desktop search, including the United States, Google called this shift \"huge opportunity\".　　Google Senior Vice President for search products Amite·xinhaer (Amit Singhal) know that this change is a huge challenge for the company. He recently said in an interview at Google headquarters in mountain view, California: \"in the past more than 10 years, we make money by desktop side, into the mobile era is not the case, we will be more vulnerable to attack. We must start again from the search. ”　　Search from the voice virtual assistant began to change　　In 1998 launched Google search with a blue link, to this day, nature of changes happening in the way people access information. On the Smartphone, the traditional presentation of search results are not ideal, placed on a Smartphone or smart TV is bad. Google plans to implant a software more devices, it must rethink the presentation of search results.　　Where do you start? To find a way, to Google\'s huge Internet services, artificial intelligence, massive user data, related to both it and Google Mobile APP, which is voice search and Google Now. Search with your voice using speech instead of text the user can enter, Google users Now can predict before you actually enter text information. Google wants people search behavior changes, through the search box before, and now into a continuous dialogue between the user and all-purpose Assistant, Assistant to intervene and to satisfy the user request.　　If Google did not develop the perfect Virtual Assistant, Apple will do. Apple\'s Challenger Siri is probably the most famous, and implanted it in the iPhone, this year has also been installed in the Apple Apple TV and Watch. Built into the Microsoft Windows 10 Cortana. Amazon developing the Echo, it\'s a smart appliances, people receiving voice commands Echo can be placed in the living room. Facebook has developed digital assistants m.　　They all think that virtual assistants will be the future control of cars, appliances and other networked devices.

Google in the future as in the past, please? This is the question we thought. ”　　Amitabh Singhal is 47 years old, it joined Google in 2000, is the 176th member of staff of the company has been working in the search sector. When he was a child, just like the Star Trek (Star Trek). Initially, Google voice search project, code-named Majel, the name comes from the artificial intelligence in the computer\'s voice actor, Starship Enterprise.　　Amitabh Singhal subsequently unveiled a prototype wearable devices, these assumptions were merged into one. This is a collar pin devices, it supports Bluetooth, microphone, simply click on activate, before Google has never publicly demonstrated the device. Device through the speakers or headphones, and users with Google without having to phone conversations. Such a device and Captain Picard in the Star Trek film to use the equipment are very similar. Amitabh Singhal says: \"I\'ve always wanted a PIN. Anything you ask it to give fluent replies, that is why we set out to develop a prototype device, see how it works. \"The devices are far from through the testing phase, but how Google engineers are working hard to find new and more natural search.　　However, prior to that there were difficult issues need to be addressed. Biggest challenge comes from the speech, which includes the user\'s voice, also including virtual character\'s voice.　　Voice search challenge　　In the search box, Google\'s relationship with users questions and answers based on pure level. Enter our ideas into the search box, and then in the blue links to find answers to your favorite. We may even say that search is not guided by Google, it may not even exist. Survey shows that people tend to remember the fact itself, but remember very clearly the process of finding.

Users will have an expected, they think Google will listen and understand each word, and then respond in a simple and natural way, as well as dialogue between man and man. Google speech recognition experts, search, scientists fulanxisike·bifeisi (Francoise Beaufays) said: \"the mobile phone must be the user\'s friends, it must be the question of open, natural language understanding, so users will feel comfortable. ” [Disney iPhone case](http://www.nodcase.com/disney-cartoon-mickey-mouse-silicone-iphone-5-case-p-3874.html)　　Google has been partially resolved \"hearing\" problems, thanks mainly to improvements in algorithms and computing power increase over the past 2 years, Google voice search error rate has dropped from 23% to 8%. Google VP of engineering sikete·hefuman conversational search (Scott Huffman) said that in September he was in Barcelona when a noisy nightclub using voice inputs, equipment, good record all his pronunciation, he said: \"I think the voice and text input precision, and even more accurate. ”　　However, the recorded words to understand human language is not the same thing. You want the voice search has become as wise as science fiction movies, Google still has a long way to go. Amitabh Singhal says: \"the text\'s meaning has puzzled computer science, improve natural language--that is, to better understand what we say--remains one of our key challenges to conquer. ”　　Voice search should have personality?　　Some people think that Google voice search is not a personality. For example, when a user asked Apple\'s Siri what is the meaning of life, Siri said some wisecracks, she said: \"Kant answered this question! \"\" Life is a movie. \"\" So far all the evidence suggests it was chocolate. \"Ask Google, see only a list of search results.　　Google explained that the surrender of a personality is well thought out. Amitabh Singhal find the joke inserted Assistant service gives Google\'s App more engaging, but it will give the user a false impression, like process doesn\'t work the same. Amitabh Singhal said, \"I\'m not saying there should be no individuality, but is not yet fully established it in science. \"Starting from 2010, Apple\'s Siri learned to tell a joke. Amitabh Singhal says: \"look at the real life first might be fun, but slowly ceases to be a character. ”　　Google will focus on machine learning algorithms, it can make the machine learning, without human engineers are becoming more and more smart. The more people using speech search, Google voice algorithms can understand different accents. Hoffman said: \"when I speak, your voice into the image in your brain, as in the sentence makes sense. In a sense, language models is the same, but in a different data source, voice search data sources from people\'s questions. ”　　In order to better understand users, Google upgrades Google Now, it scans the user\'s Smartphone screen, access to App-related information or links, a move that attracted a lot of criticism. In June, Apple CEO Tim Cook had accused said: \"some of the most prominent and successful companies trick users, access to user personal information, then your business is built on the above information, they try to master all of your, and then turn it into money, I think it is wrong. ”　　Google stressed that they do not sell data to third parties, but Google had to admit the fact that Google Now more users running the better. Amitabh Singhal says: \"just how little we need to know more about users, you can create a better future. If they gain value, you should use it. If you do not wish to delete data into account. ”　　How many people find the value? This is a problem. Google did not disclose how much Google Now has user, only that the service was \"strong growth\". Google did not follow the Google Now monthly active users, they are concerned are active users.　　In talking about the future of search products, Google rarely refer to desktop search. Even when we discuss new features for mobile, Google will first ask the question: If you are in a car, or on the wrist, in the living room, people\'s interactions would be different? Hoffman said: \"we spend more and more time to think about these devices, these devices, voice is the only option. ”　　How Google will try to in the future, this is people are guessing. In Hoffman\'s prospects in the future there will be a small device, it has a built-in Google digital assistants, could be implanted in traditional household appliances. Hoffman said: \"we don\'t know what the device was born, but we know it will come. Whether you\'re cooking or driving, or whether you\'re walking the dogs or play with their children, search and natural language is the way people interact and obtain information and services. ”[![Alt Disney iPhone case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/iphone5/disney_store_ip5131_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/disney-cartoon-mickey-mouse-silicone-iphone-5-case-p-3874.html)　　Amitabh Singhal also says: \"Google turning data into information, users turn information into knowledge, knowledge into wisdom. If Google tells me the answer, this would be a good thing, so that I can spare 5 minutes, to accompany the child. It enriched my life in a different way. That\'s how I feel. ”[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: Science and technology Design
