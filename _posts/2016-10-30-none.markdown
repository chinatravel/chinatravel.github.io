![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5766/30038286784_a645dd372e_b.jpg)DxO is One DxO company launched a Lighting interface for an external lens for the iPhone, while DxO company best known for its subsidiary of DxO Mark camera review sites, and DxO image processing software. DxO One uses 20 million pixels, 1-inch CMOS, Iris f/11-f/1.8, equivalent to 32mm, no optical image stabilization, seen from the hardware parameters, apart from the lack of optical image stabilization, but significantly ahead of the other phone, then what is the actual effect of?![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5821/30552985492_924f8eb5ab_b.jpg)Join QX100 comparison includes the same external cameras, as well as the culmination of the Android mobile phone LG V10, and popular iPhone 6s. QX100 and DxO One as two external cameras, both similar in parameters.Appearance![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5500/30036081943_f5f059d4d5_b.jpg)![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5721/30038316194_da018853ae_b.jpg)![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5566/30038321784_922d29c8c6_b.jpg)![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5799/30669692775_e2f7424677_b.jpg)DxO One outer package is very simple, and smart phones on the market today packed the same, after you open the package, we can see a DxO One camera body, charging a DxO head, a data cable and user guide.![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5588/30036117483_8933929fb1_b.jpg)![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5645/30581828701_d37969c204_b.jpg)![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5516/30553049672_b941990d7e_b.jpg)![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5482/30370116780_aa5e222441_b.jpg)DxO One overall style is relatively tough, use a mixed silver-black color scheme, part Silver metallic paint, while the fuselage using the plastic materials, however, feel and weight, are not too obtrusive, external camera is small and kind of product.DxO-protective lens cover for the sliding friction of One, has a small OLED secondary screen on the back, and little information displayed on the screen will only display the power, shooting mode, a film formats, and so on. Below the secondary screen is Micro USB interface and a Micro SD card slot.Comparative QX100,DxO the volume does have a big advantage, we like DxO can even put it in a little pocket, and use when you need to insert the lighting of the iPhone interface, QX100 bigger to fit in the Pocket, and smart NFC/Wi-Fi connections via mobile phones, use more cumbersome. While portable/ease of DxO does much better than QX100, but it can also sacrifice an optical zoom, QX100 support up to 3.6 times optical zoom, which is the main difference between the two.DxO Lighting interface to achieve a \"plug and play\", after you insert a cell phone, it can be carried out by a shaft 45 Â° counterclockwise rotation, the pros and cons can be inserted, not afraid of incorrect insertion, reverse plug can also be used as a self portrait.DxO One charging specifications for 5V/1A, slow charging.UseDxO tutorialThere are a variety of shooting modes can be selected, you can view photos in DxO camera informationWhen we insert the DxO One after the iPhone, iPhone will appear playing the prompts from the official App Store download DxO software, opens the DxO software after downloading, it will have a simple DxO tutorial. Into software Hou, DxO of using is simple, like we usually Android phone photo General, but it as external camera, function will than iPhone more, like in m document (manual mode) in the it can for ISO, and aperture, and shutter of regulation, ISO up can up 12800, and shutter most slow 15 seconds, and aperture maximum for f/1.8, addition shooting good of photos can select exists phone/DxO One of Micro SD card in the, and if is shooting RAW/ Super set of RAW, and it will be stored by default in the DxO One Micro SD card.Due to the DxO is perfectly free to One Micro SD card, and DxO One does not insert a Micro SD card cannot be photographed, a slow Micro SD card and will be affecting the use of DxO One experience, so we must have a high speed Micro SD card only.During use, DxO One shot soon, almost photo frame speed of the iPhone itself, and there is no difference, QX100 framing is very slow, which is impacting the user experience.Using DxO One self portraitSample comparisonLeft: DxO One right: QX100Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10100% image to enlarge:Left: DxO One right: QX100[![Alt OtterBox iPad Mini Case](http://www.awacase.com/images/large/apple_case/otterbox_defender_mi071_lrg.jpg)](http://www.mkfans.com/otterbox-defender-ipad-mini-series-case-pink-p-2087.html)Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10Time: January 22, 2016 17:05-17:30Location: Nanshan District, Shenzhen kexing Science ParkShooting weather: cloudy, outdoor 11 cDue to the cloudy weather at the time, and near the evening, although it is outdoors, but the light is still not adequate. In the first set of proofs during the day, four white balancing device came close, and after the 100% image to enlarge, we can see, with 1 inch, 20 million by the end of pixel QX100 and DxO One performance better than the iPhone 6s and LG V10, especially QX100, resolution compared to other three not only has obvious advantages, higher purity of the picture.Left: DxO One right: QX100Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10100% image to enlarge:Left: DxO One right: QX100Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10Time: January 22, 2016 17:05-17:30Location: Nanshan District, Shenzhen kexing Science ParkShooting weather: cloudy, outdoor 11 cIn the second set of proofs, we directly comparing 100% image, 4 devices can clearly show the distance of the fonts on the site, they are able to fully display the site details in the original scene, DxO One, QX100, LG V10 with iPhone 6s, their advantage was reflected in their higher pixels.Left: DxO One right: QX100Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10100% image to enlarge:Left: DxO One right: QX100Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10Time: January 22, 2016 17:05-17:30Location: Nanshan District, Shenzhen kexing Science ParkShooting weather: cloudy, outdoor 11 cIn the third set of proofs, white balance: LG V10>QX100>iPhone 6s>DxO One of four device can clearly show to be filmed in the building lighting, DxO minimum exposure of One of them, QX100 highest exposure, DxO One QX100 rich shadow detail, noise is less than iPhone 6s and LG V10.Left: DxO One right: QX100Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10100% image to enlarge:Left: DxO One right: QX100Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10Time: January 22, 2016 17:05-17:30Location: Nanshan District, Shenzhen kexing Science ParkShooting weather: cloudy, light rain, outdoor 11 cIn the fourth set of proofs in the DxO One white balance has gone wrong, the overall white balance warm, the reality is that when it is raining, the white balance: QX100>LG V10>iPhone 6s>DxO One. When four devices display signs in the distance and resolution are a significant decline, QX100 through painting, picture more pure, but fonts are sharp enough, and LG V10 font while sharpening, but the whole picture sharpening too much, in this group of DxO is One of the worst scenario.Left: DxO One right: QX100Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10100% image to enlarge:Left: DxO One right: QX100 [OtterBox iPad Mini Case](http://www.mkfans.com/otterbox-defender-ipad-mini-series-case-pink-p-2087.html)Left: DxO One RAW output after right JPG: after Super RAW output JPGLeft: iPhone 6s right: LG V10Time: January 22, 2016 18:00-18:30Location: Nanshan District, Shenzhen kexing Science ParkShooting weather: cloudy, light rain, outdoor 10 degrees CelsiusIn the fifth set of proofs in the flare-resistant performance of four equipment similar to white balance performance, iPhone 6s>LG V10>QX100>DxO One, easy treasure on the font resolution, QX100>iPhone 6s>DxO One>LG V10. But we note that DxO One font on and iPhone 6s zhangzhongyila Po \"pair of 11 ex-gratia package\" has become a white font, which was supposed to be a yellow font.In addition, in this scene, we also tried the Super of the DxO RAW output, compared to ordinary RAW, both performances were similar.Left: DxO One right: QX100Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10100% image to enlarge:Left: DxO One right: QX100Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10Time: January 22, 2016 18:00-18:30Location: Nanshan District, Shenzhen kexing Science Park in the underground garageShooting weather: cloudy, light rain, outdoor 10 degrees CelsiusIn the sixth set of proofs in the white balance performance, LG V10>QX100>iPhone 6s>DxO One,DxO One white balance off in this scenario, and was originally a red roll background, displayed in DxO One Orange, QX100 either analytic or is that purity compared to other three great advantages for machine.Left: DxO One right: QX100Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s6oS7Nm3bQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s6oS7Nm3bQ) 100% original:Left: DxO One right: QX100Left: iPhone 6s right: LG V10 [OtterBox iPad Mini Case](https://losangeles.craigslist.org/sfv/mob/5584314796.html)Time: January 22, 2016 at 19:00Location: Nanshan District, Shenzhen kexing Science Park A2Shooting weather: cloudy, light rain, outdoor 9 cNote: this time LG V10 trigger night modeIn seventh group proofs in the, white balance performance Shang, due to building glow with time and changes, so in building of color displayed Shang, four who are has differences, in this group Super weak light in the, no optical anti-shake of iPhone 6s and DxO One obviously weak, especially iPhone 6s of analytical force declined serious, and noise points up, DxO One of performance also is General, LG V10 and QX100 is has obviously of advantage.SummaryFrom looking at the proofs of performance, QX100 has obvious advantages in comparison to other three devices on the picture quality, QX100 as a portable, external camera it\'s portability, and usability than DxO One. First, QX100 compared to DxO One is too heavy, bulky, and simply can not put it in your pocket, but it\'s really slow. QX100 is connected via Wi-Fi mobile phone, it has a slow transfer rate, so viewing and transfer the photos to the phone album speed is very slow, and viewfinder and shooting after the set difference, although good quality, but the experience is poor.DxO contrast QX100 One poor picture quality, but its far better user experience than QX100, lighter, more portable, Plug and pull through a Lighting interface, viewing almost indistinguishable from mobile phones, photo transfer is much faster than QX100, but the proofs of its obvious advantages, under some scenarios than LG V10. DxO One the most serious problem is not quality, but its battery life, filmed continuously for about 1 hour, took less than 20 proofs altogether, electricity is the only 50%.DxO One of the United States and Asia sells for $ 549 (approximately 3600 RMB), prices are slightly higher, quality expectations, and poor battery life, do not recommend purchase, but if you now still have to buy it, our network of Lei Feng geek this product was purchased last, faith friends can go and find out.
